<h1>Alembic</h1>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.alembic.io/">Alembic home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic distills complex, animated
scenes into a non-procedural, application-independent set of baked geometric results.
This ‘distillation’ of scenes into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of
lighting and rendering scenes into rendered image data.</p>
<p>Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex procedural geometric constructions.
It is very specifically <strong>not</strong> concerned with storing the complex dependency graph
of procedural tools used to create the computed results.
For example, Alembic will efficiently store the animated vertex positions and
animated transforms that result from an arbitrarily complex animation and simulation process
which could involve enveloping, corrective shapes, volume-preserving simulations,
cloth and flesh simulations, and so on.
Alembic will not attempt to store a representation of the network of computations (rigs, basically)
which are required to produce the final, animated vertex positions and animated transforms.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In brief, Alembic can be used to write an animated mesh to a drive, and read it back quickly and efficiently.
This means that a mesh can be animated with a very CPU-intensive rig and then ‘baked’ to an Alembic file.
Finally it can be load into the shot file for shading and lighting with only moderate CPU usage.</p>
<p>Due to the Open Source nature of the Alembic standard as well as
the C++ library implementing that standard, <strong>Blender can be used in a hybrid pipeline</strong>.
For example, other software, such as Houdini or Maya, can export files to Alembic,
which can then be loaded, shaded, and rendered in Blender.
It is also possible to animate characters (or other models) in Blender, export to Alembic, and
load those files into other software for further processing.</p>

<dt>Shutter Open, Close</dt><dd><p>Shutter Open/Close define the interval [open, close] over which those samples are taken.
The valid range is -1 to 1, where -1 indicates the previous frame,
0 indicates the current frame, and 1 indicates the next frame.</p>
<p>For example, if information for detailed mesh motion blur is desired, some subframes around
the current frame can be written to Alembic by using a sample count of 5,
Shutter Open at -0.25 and Shutter Close at 0.25.
This mimics a “180 degree” shutter, opening 90 degrees before the frame
and closing 90 degrees after the frame.</p>

<dt>Flatten Hierarchy</dt><dd><p>When disabled, parent/child relations between objects are exported too. Any parent object that
is not exported itself, but with children that <em>are</em> exported, is replaced by an empty.
When enabled, parent/child relations are not exported, and transformations are all written in world coordinates.</p>

<dt>Custom Properties</dt><dd><p>When enabled (which it is by default), custom properties are exported to Alembic as well.
The following custom property types are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Numbers (<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>) and strings. These are exported as arrays of
a single element, so <code>47</code> will be exported as <code>[47]</code> to Alembic,
and <code>"Agent"</code> to <code>["Agent"]</code>. This matches the behavior of
many other <abbr title="Digital Content Creator">DCCs</abbr>.</p></li>
<li><p>Lists of numbers and strings. These are exported as-is, so <code>[327, 47]</code> is exported as <code>[327, 47]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Matrices and nested arrays of numbers. These are flattened into one long list,
so a 3×2 matrix of numbers will become a list of 6 numbers. Similarly,
nested lists <code>[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]</code> will be exported as <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Numbers can be animated as well.</p></li>

<h2>Importing Alembic Files</h2>
<p>When importing an Alembic file, <a href="../../modeling/modifiers/modify/mesh_sequence_cache.html">Mesh Sequence Cache modifiers</a>
are automatically added to time-varying meshes. For time-varying object transforms
(so animation of rotation, location, or scale)
the <a href="../../animation/constraints/transform/transform_cache.html#bpy-types-transformcacheconstraint">Transform Cache Constraint</a> is used.</p>
</section>
<section id="custom-split-normals-of-meshes">
<h2>Custom Split Normals of Meshes</h2>
<p>Blender supports the import and export of <a href="../../modeling/meshes/structure.html#modeling-meshes-normals-custom">custom normals</a> to
Alembic files. As a basic rule of thumb, a completely smooth mesh will be exported without normals
and thus produce the smallest Alembic file. This is reflected in the importer; an Alembic mesh
without normals is loaded as a smooth mesh.</p>
<p>On export, for every mesh:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If it has <em>Custom Loop Normals</em> then the loop normals are exported.</p></li>
<li><p>If one or more polygons are marked flat then loop normals are also exported.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, no normals are exported.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On import, when the Alembic mesh contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Loop normals (<code>kFacevaryingScope</code>) are used as custom loop normals, and enable <em>Auto Smooth</em> to have
Blender actually use them.</p></li>
<li><p>Vertex normals (<code>kVertexScope</code> or <code>kVaryingScope</code>) are convert to loop normals, and handle as above.</p></li>
<li><p>If there are no normals then the mesh is marked as smooth.</p></li>
<li><p>Unsupported normal types (<code>kConstantScope</code>, <code>kUniformScope</code>, <code>kUnknownScope</code>) are handled as <em>no normals</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When an imported mesh does not contain normals, the final look can be controlled by enabling
the <a href="../../modeling/meshes/structure.html#auto-smooth">Auto Smooth</a> checkbox and altering the threshold angle.</p>
</section>
<section id="handling-time">
<h2>Handling Time</h2>
<p>Unlike Blender and many other applications and file formats, Alembic files don’t have any concept of frames.
Alembic works purely with time, and values that are sampled over time. For example,
there is no way to distinguish 30 FPS with 2 samples per frame, and 60 FPS with 1 sample per frame.
This has caused many developers to just
<a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/55288">hard-coded 24 FPS</a>
when reading Alembic files.</p>
<p>Blender uses the current scene frame rate to convert a frame number (in Blender) to a time
in seconds (in Alembic). As a result, you can import an Alembic file that was produced at 120 FPS into
a Blender scene that is 30 FPS and still not see any time stretching.</p>
