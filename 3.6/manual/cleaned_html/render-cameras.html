<h1>Cameras</h1>
<p>A camera is an object that provides a means of rendering images from Blender.
It defines which portion of a scene is visible in the rendered image.</p>
<p>Cameras are invisible in renders, so they do not have any material or texture settings.
However, they do have <em>Object</em> and <em>Editing</em> setting panels available which are displayed
when a camera is the active object.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Perspective</dt><dd><p>This matches how you view things in the real world.
Objects in the distance will appear smaller than objects in the foreground,

<dt>Focal Length/Field of View</dt><dd><p>The <a href="../glossary/index.html#term-Focal-Length">Focal Length</a> controls the amount of zoom, i.e.
the amount of the scene which is visible all at once.
Longer focal lengths result in a smaller <abbr title="Field of View">FOV</abbr> (more zoom),
while short focal lengths allow you to see more of the scene at once
(larger <abbr title="Field of View">FOV</abbr>, less zoom).</p>

<p>While the camera is moving towards an object the <em>Focal Length</em> property can be decreased
to produce a <em>Dolly Zoom</em> camera effect, or vice versa.</p>

<dt>Orthographic</dt><dd><p>With <em>Orthographic</em> perspective objects always appear at their actual size, regardless of distance.

<p>Note that this is effectively the only setting which applies to orthographic perspective.
Since parallel lines do not converge in orthographic mode (no vanishing points),
the lens shift settings are equivalent to translating the camera in the 3D Viewport.</p>

<h3>Depth of Field</h3>
<p>Real-world cameras transmit light through a lens that bends and focuses it onto the sensor.
Because of this, objects that are a certain distance away are in focus,
but objects in front and behind that are blurred.</p>
<figure id="id7">
<figcaption>
<p>Example of DOF bokeh effect.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The area in focus is called the <em>focal point</em> and can be set using either an exact value,
or by using the distance between the camera and a chosen object:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Focus Object</dt><dd><p>Choose an object which will determine the focal point. Linking an object will deactivate the distance parameter.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Focal Distance</dt><dd><p>Sets the distance to the focal point when no <em>Focus Object</em> is specified.
If <em>Limits</em> are enabled, a yellow cross is shown on the camera line of sight at this distance.</p>
<div>
<p>Hint</p>
<p>Hover the mouse over the <em>Distance</em> property and press <kbd>E</kbd> to use a special <em>Depth Picker</em>.
Then click on a point in the 3D Viewport to sample the distance from that point to the camera.</p>

<section id="safe-areas">
<h3>Safe Areas</h3>
<p>Safe areas are guides used to position elements to ensure that
the most important parts of the content can be seen across all screens.</p>
<p>Different screens have varying amounts of <a href="../glossary/index.html#term-Overscan">Overscan</a> (especially older TV sets).
That means that not all content will be visible to all viewers,
since parts of the image surrounding the edges are not shown.
To work around this problem TV producers defined two areas where content is guaranteed to be shown:
action safe and title safe.</p>
<p>Modern LCD/plasma screens with purely digital signals have no <a href="../glossary/index.html#term-Overscan">Overscan</a>,
yet safe areas are still considered best practice and may be legally required for broadcast.</p>
<p>In Blender, safe areas can be set from the Camera and Sequencer views.</p>
<figure id="id8">
<figcaption>
<p>Red line: Action safe. Green line: Title safe.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Safe Areas can be customized by their outer margin,
which is a percentage scale of the area between the center and the render size.
Values are shared between the Video Sequence editor and camera view.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Title Safe Margins X/Y</dt><dd><p>Also known as <em>Graphics Safe</em>.
Place all important information (graphics or text) inside this area to
ensure it can be seen by the majority of viewers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Action Safe Margins X/Y</dt><dd><p>Make sure any significant action or characters in the shot are inside this area.
This zone also doubles as a sort of “margin” for the screen which can be used
to keep elements from piling up against the edges.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Each country sets a legal standard for broadcasting.
These include, among other things, specific values for safe areas.
Blender defaults for safe areas follow the EBU (European Union) standard.
Make sure you are using the correct values when working for broadcast to avoid any trouble.</p>
</div>
<section id="center-cut-safe-areas">
<h4>Center-Cut Safe Areas</h4>
<p>Center-cuts are a second set of safe areas to ensure content
is seen correctly on screens with a different aspect ratio.
Old TV sets receiving <code>16:9</code> or <code>21:9</code> video will cut off the sides.
Position content inside the center-cut areas to make sure the most important elements
of your composition can still be visible in these screens.</p>
<p>Blender defaults show a <code>4:3</code> (square) ratio inside <code>16:9</code> (widescreen).</p>
