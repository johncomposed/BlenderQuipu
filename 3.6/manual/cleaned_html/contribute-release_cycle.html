<h1>Release Cycle</h1>
<p>A new Blender version is targeted to be released every 3 months.
The actual <a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Process/Release_Cycle">release cycle</a> for a specific release is longer,
and overlaps the previous and next release cycle.</p>
<section id="branches">
<h2>Branches</h2>
<p>Work is done in two branches:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>blender-v{VERSION}-release</code> branch: fixes and other incremental improvements.</p></li>
<li><p><code>master</code> branch: documentation for new features and improvements for the release after that.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>blender-v{VERSION}-release</code> branch will be available for 5 weeks prior to the release date.
At the same time <code>master</code> will be open for the next release,
giving 2 months to add documentation for new features of the next release, and another month to make improvements.</p>

<h2>Bcon Phases</h2>
<p>Each Blender version has its own Bcon phase,
indicating which types of changes are allowed to be committed and what writers are focusing on.</p>
<p>That means for example that Blender 2.90 can be in Bcon3 (wrapping up),
while Blender 2.91 is in Bcon1 (new features and changes).</p>
