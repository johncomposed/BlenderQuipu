<h1>Surface</h1>
<p>Surface editing has even fewer tools and options than its curve counterpart,
but has many common points with it…
So this page covers (or tries to cover) all the subjects,
from the basics of surface editing to more advanced topics, like retopology.</p>

<p><a href="../../../editors/3dview/controls/snapping.html">Mesh snapping</a>

</div>
<p>This tool is a bit similar to its <a href="../../meshes/tools/spin.html">mesh counterpart</a>
but with less control and options (in fact, there is none!).</p>
<p>It only works on selected “surfaces” made of <em>one U row</em> (and not with one V row),
so-called “surface curves”, by “extruding” this “cross section” in a square pattern.
While automatically adjusting the weights of control points to get a perfect circular extrusion
(this also implies closing the surface along the V axis), following exactly the same principle
as for the <em>NURBS Tube</em> or <em>NURBS Torus</em> primitives.</p>

</div>
<p>Similar as with meshes and curves, this tool duplicates the selection.
The copy is selected and placed in move mode, so you can move it to another place.</p>
<p>However, with surfaces there are some selections that cannot be duplicated,
in which case they will just be placed in move mode… In fact,
only selections forming a <em>single</em> valid sub-grid are copyable; let us see this in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can copy a single control point.
From it, you will be able to “extrude” a “surface curve” along the U axis,
and then extrude this unique U row along the V axis to create a real new surface.</p></li>
<li><p>You can copy a single continuous part of a row (or a whole row, of course).
This will give you a new <em>U row</em>, even if you selected (part of) a V row!</p></li>
<li><p>You can copy a single whole sub-grid.</p></li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Trying to duplicate several valid “sub-grids” (even being single points)
at once will not work; you will have to do it one after the other…</p>

</div>
<p>The <em>Split</em> operator splits a selected segment of a surface from the rest of the surface.
This segment can then be moved or altered without affecting the other surface.
If a single control point is selected the <em>Split</em> operator will create a new singular loose control point;
leaving the previously selected control point attached to the rest of the surface.</p>

</div>
<p>Surface objects that are made of multiple distinct parts can be separated into their own
objects by selecting the desired segments and using <em>Separate</em>.
Note, if there is only one surface in a surface object,
<em>Separate</em> will create a new surface object with no control points.</p>

</div>
<p>As in <a href="../../curves/editing/curve.html#modeling-curves-toggle-cyclic">curves</a>,
surfaces can be closed (cyclic) or open. However, as surfaces are 2D,
you can control this property independently along the U and V axes.</p>
<p>To toggle the cyclic property of a surface along one axis,
use <em>Toggle Cyclic</em> and choose either <em>Cyclic U</em> or <em>Cyclic V</em> from the pop-up menu.
The corresponding surface’s outer edges will join together to form a “closed” surface.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Inner and Outer</p>
<p>Surfaces have an “inner” and “outer” face, the first being black whereas the latter is correctly shaded.
When you close a surface in one or two directions, you might get an entirely black object! In this case,

<p>Also remember that NURBS order cannot be higher than its number of control points in a given axis,
so it might decrease when you delete some control points…
Of course, when only one row remains, the surface becomes a “surface curve”; when only one point remains,
there is no more visible surface; and when all points are deleted, the surface itself is deleted.</p>

<p>In the image below (left), a row of control points has been selected by initially selecting
the one control point and using <a href="../selecting.html#bpy-ops-curve-select-row">Select Control Point Row</a> to select the remaining
control points. Then, using <a href="#delete">Delete</a> <em>Vertices</em>,
the selected row of control points is erased, resulting in the image below (right).</p>
