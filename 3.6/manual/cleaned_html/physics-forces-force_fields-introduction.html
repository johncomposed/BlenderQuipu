<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Force fields offer a way to influence a simulation, in example to add extra movement.
<a href="../../particles/index.html">Particles</a>, <a href="../../soft_body/index.html">Soft Bodies</a>,
<a href="../../rigid_body/index.html">Rigid Bodies</a>, and <a href="../../cloth/index.html">Cloth objects</a>
can all be affected by forces fields.
Force fields automatically affect everything.
To remove a simulation or particle system from their influence,
simply turn down the influence of that type of force field in its Field Weights panel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All types of objects and particles can generate fields,
but only curve object can bear a <a href="types/curve_guide.html">Curve Guide</a> field.</p></li>
<li><p>Force fields can also be generated from particles.
See <a href="../../particles/emitter/physics/index.html">Particle Physics</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The objects need to share at least one common layer to have an effect.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You may limit the effect on particles to a group of objects
(see the <a href="../../particles/emitter/physics/index.html">Particle Physics</a> page).</p>

<p>To create a single force field,
you can select Add ‣ Force Field and select the desired force field.
This method creates an empty with the force field attached.</p>

<p>To create a field from an existing object you have to select the object and
change to the <em>Physics</em> tab. Select the field type in the <em>Fields</em> menu.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>After changing the fields <em>Fields</em> panel or deflection <em>Collision</em> panel settings,
you have to recalculate the particle, soft body or cloth system by <em>Free Cache</em>,
this is not done automatically.</p>
<p>Particles react to all kinds of force fields,
soft bodies only to <em>Force</em>, <em>Wind</em>, <em>Vortex</em>
(they react on <em>Harmonic</em> fields but not in a useful way).</p>

<section id="common-field-settings">
<h2>Common Field Settings</h2>
<p>Most fields have the same settings, even though they act very differently.
Settings unique to a field type are described below.
Curve Guide and Texture fields have very different options.</p>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-shape">
<dt>Shape</dt><dd><p>Sets the direction which is used to calculate the effector force.
For force fields from an empty object only <em>Point</em>, <em>Line</em> and <em>Plane</em> shapes are available,
as for a field from a 3D object there are additional <em>Surface</em> and <em>Every Point</em> options,
and <em>Curve</em> for a field from a curve.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Point:</dt>
<dd><p>Point with omni-directional influence. Uses the object origin as the effector point.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Line:</dt>
<dd><p>The force only acts in the local XY plane, using the Z axis line as the effector.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Plane:</dt>
<dd><p>The force only acts in the local Z direction, using the XY axis plane as the effector.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Surface:</dt>
<dd><p>The force field acts on a 3D object’s surface.
In this case, the Z axis is the surface normal.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Every Point:</dt>
<dd><p>Uses every vertex in the mesh object as an effector point.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-strength">
<dt>Strength</dt><dd><p>The strength of the field effect.
This can be positive or negative to change the direction that the force operates in.
A force field’s strength is scaled with the force object’s scale,
allowing you to scale up and down the scene, keeping the same effects.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-flow">
<dt>Flow</dt><dd><p>If nonzero, this adds a drag force proportional and opposite to the point velocity.</p>
<p>This effectively re-interprets the force field so that the <em>Strength</em> to <em>Flow</em> ratio
at a certain point defines the velocity of an “air flow” field, and objects are
encouraged to follow the flow by the resistance caused by the <em>Flow</em> drag force.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-apply-to-rotation">
<dt>Affect</dt><dd><dl>
<dt>Location</dt><dd><p>Influence the location of particles and other physics entities.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rotation</dt><dd><p>Influence the rotation of particles with <a href="../../particles/emitter/rotation.html">Dynamic Rotation</a>.
The option is not relevant for other types of physics systems.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Disabling both options completely deactivates the force field.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-noise">
<dt>Noise Amount</dt><dd><p>Adds noise to the strength of the force.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-seed">
<dt>Seed</dt><dd><p>Changes the seed of the random noise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-use-absorption">
<dt>Absorption</dt><dd><p>Force gets absorbed by collision objects.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-wind-factor">
<dt>Wind Factor</dt><dd><p>Specifies how much the force is reduced when acting parallel to a surface, e.g. cloth.
If set to 1, only the normal component of the force is taken into account.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<section id="falloff">
<h3>Falloff</h3>
<p>Here you can specify the shape of the force field
(if the falloff <em>Power</em> is greater than 0).</p>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-falloff-type">
<dt>Shape</dt><dd><dl>
<dt>Cone:</dt>
<dd><p>The falloff results in a cone-shaped force field. Additional options are the same as those of <em>Tube</em> options.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sphere:</dt>
<dd><p>The falloff is uniform in all directions, as in a sphere.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tube:</dt>
<dd><p>The falloff results in a tube-shaped force field.
The field’s <em>Radial Power</em> can be adjusted,
as well as the <em>Minimum</em> and <em>Maximum</em> distances of the field.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-z-direction">
<dt>Z Direction</dt><dd><p>The direction the force affects on the Z axis.</p>
<dl>
<dt>+Z:</dt>
<dd><p>The force only has an affect on the positive Z axis.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-Z:</dt>
<dd><p>The force only has an affect on the negative Z axis.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Both Z:</dt>
<dd><p>The force has an affect on the positive and negative Z axis.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-falloff-power">
<dt>Power</dt><dd><p>How the power of the force field changes with the distance from the force field.
If <em>r</em> is the distance from the origin of the object, the force changes with 1/(<em>r</em> - <em>min</em> + 1)<sup>power</sup>.
A falloff of 2 changes the force field with 1/(<em>r</em> - <em>min</em> + 1)<sup>2</sup>,
which is similar to the falloff of gravitational pull.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-distance-min">
<dt>Min Distance</dt><dd><p>The distance from the object’s origin, up to where the force field is effective with full strength.
If you have a falloff of 0, this parameter will have no effect,
because the field is effective with full strength up to <em>Max Distance</em> (or infinite).
Shown by an additional circle around the object.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-fieldsettings-distance-max">
<dt>Max Distance</dt><dd><p>Specifies the maximum radius in which the force field affects other objects
(shown by an additional circle around the object).</p>
