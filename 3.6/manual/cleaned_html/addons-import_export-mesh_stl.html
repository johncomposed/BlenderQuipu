<p>This format is useful if you intend to import/export the files for CAD software.
It is also commonly used for loading into 3D printing software.</p>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Currently the script does not handle importing or exporting of normals
and does not handle endian-ness, there is nothing in the STL specification about it.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Use the operator to import ASCII or binary STL-files, you can select multiple files at once.
For exporting you can select multiple objects and they will be exported as a single STL-file.
You can select between ASCII/binary file format (binary is more compact).
You can also choose to enable or disable the modifiers during the export.</p>
