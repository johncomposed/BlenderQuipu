<section id="points">
<h2>Points</h2>
<p>The main element used in editing Grease Pencil objects are points.
Points represent a single point in 3D space.</p>
<p>Each point stores all the properties that define the final appearance of the strokes
as its location, thickness, alpha, weight and UV rotation for textures.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Point (Grease Pencil) and Vertex (meshes) are equivalent names.</p>

</section>
<section id="edit-lines">
<h2>Edit Lines</h2>
<p>Points are always connected by a straight line,
which you see when you are editing in Edit Mode or when you look at a stroke in wireframe view.
They are invisible on the rendered image and are used to construct the final stroke.</p>
</section>
<section id="strokes">
<h2>Strokes</h2>
<p>The stroke is the rendered image of the points and edit lines,
using a particular <a href="materials/introduction.html">Grease Pencil material</a>.
(Grease Pencil materials are linked at stroke level.)</p>
