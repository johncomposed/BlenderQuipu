<dt>Pull</dt><dd><p>The spring stiffness for edges (how much the edges are allowed to stretch).
A low value means very weak springs (a very elastic material),
a high value is a strong spring (a stiffer material) that resists being pulled apart.</p>
<p>A value of 0.5 is latex, 0.9 is like a sweater, 0.999 is a highly-starched napkin or leather.
The soft body simulation tends to get unstable if you use a value of 0.999,
so you should lower this value a bit if that happens.</p>

<dt>Face</dt><dd><p>Checks for any portion of the face of the soft body mesh colliding (which is computationally intensive).
While <em>Face</em> enabled can solve collision errors, there does not seem to be any dampening settings for it.
So parts of the soft body object near a collision mesh tend to “jitter” as they bounce off and fall back,
even when there is no motion of any meshes. Edge collision has dampening, so that can be controlled,
but Deflection dampening value on a collision object does not seem to affect the face collision.</p>
