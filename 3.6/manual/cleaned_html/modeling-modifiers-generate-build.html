<h1>Build Modifier</h1>
<p>The <em>Build</em> modifier causes the faces of the mesh object to appear or disappear one after the other over time.</p>
<p>By default, faces appear in the order in which they are stored in memory (by default, the order of creation).
The face/vertex order can be altered in Edit Mode by using <a href="../../meshes/editing/mesh/sort_elements.html#mesh-edit-sort-elements">Sort Mesh Elements</a>.</p>

Changing this value gives a different “random” order when <em>Randomize</em> is checked.
This order is always the same for a given seed/mesh set.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The Build modifier can be used to make a large number of items to progressively appear,
without resorting to animating the visibility of each one by one. Examples of this include
a mesh containing vertices only, which is used as
an <a href="../../../scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/verts.html">Instancing Vertex emitter</a>,
and has the Build modifier on it. Such a setup is a workaround/technique for being able to art-direct
a semi-random layout of a collection of objects (e.g. leaves/balls forming a carpet).
This can be preferable to particles e.g. due to undesirable distribution of items leaving random gaps
and overlapping in other places.</p>
