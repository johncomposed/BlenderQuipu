<p>The whole marker can be moved with <kbd>RMB</kbd> or by dragging the anchor point (black dot) with <kbd>LMB</kbd>.
Pressing <kbd>G</kbd> also moves the whole marker. When pressing <kbd>G</kbd> twice the marker will be moved
while keeping the anchor in place. Note that the anchor point outside the pattern area is shown as a cross connected
with marker position with a dashed line.</p>
<p><kbd>S</kbd> scales the whole marker.
The whole pattern area only will be scaled by pressing <kbd>S</kbd> twice;
The Pattern can also be rotated using the <kbd>R</kbd> key which, depending on the used pivot point,
will either rotate patterns around their own centers or rotate the whole markers around e.g. the median point.</p>
<p>To match the perspective transformation of a marker on a plane, the individual corners must be edited manually.
Each marker corner can deform individually to define the shapes.
Corner positions can be edited by dragging them with a mouse.
Dragging with <kbd>LMB</kbd> will change the position of an individual corner.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Note that deforming a pattern is not only useful for planar / affine tracking.
Since only pixels within the pattern will be considered this can help to
specify a better pattern to track even for simple position tracking.</p>
</div>
<p>The Search area can not be rotated; this is intentional. It doesnâ€™t make sense to deform the search area.</p>

<section id="plane">
<h2>Plane</h2>
<p>The left bottom corner of the plane does have X/Y axis (X is red, Y is green) to
help distinguishing orientation of the plane in space.</p>
<p>It is likely that corner of the plane object need to be manually adjusted.
To do this sliding individual corners with mouse <kbd>LMB</kbd> or general transform tools
<kbd>G</kbd>, <kbd>R</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd> could be used.</p>
<p>Adjusting plane corners will keep it following the plane defined by tracks it was originally created from.</p>
