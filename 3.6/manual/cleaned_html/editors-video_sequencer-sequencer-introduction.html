<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This Sequencer view is where strips can be <a href="../../../video_editing/edit/montage/selecting.html">selected</a>,
<a href="../../../video_editing/edit/montage/editing.html">modified</a> by moving, cutting, or extending strips.
There are also several built-in <a href="../../../video_editing/edit/montage/strips/effects/index.html">effects</a>
that can be combined with other strips to change their appearance.</p>
<p>The Sequencer view is horizontally divided into <a href="channels.html">Channels</a>
each channel can contain what is called a strip.
A strip can be an image, animation, or any number of effects.
Each channel is numbered consecutively on the Y axis,
starting from zero and allows up to 128 total channels.
The X axis represents time. Each channel can contain as many strips
as it needs as long as they do not overlap. If a strip needs to overlap another,
it needs to be placed on a channel above or below the other strip.
When strips are stacked, they stack from bottom to top where the lowest channel
forms the background and the highest the foreground.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The first channel 0 is unusable as a place to put strips.
This is because it is used by the <a href="../preview/introduction.html">Sequencer Display</a>
to show a composite of all strips above channel 0.</p>
