<h1>Extrude Mesh Node</h1>
<p>The <em>Extrude Mesh Node</em> generates new vertices, edges, or faces, on selected geometry
and transforms them based on an offset.</p>
<p>The operations are similar to the <a href="../../../meshes/editing/mesh/extrude.html">extrude tools</a>
in mesh edit mode, though there are some differences. Most importantly, the node never keeps the back-faces
of the extrusion in place, they are always removed. Attribute propagation rules may also be different.</p>
<section id="inputs">
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Mesh</dt><dd><p>Standard geometry input.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Selection</dt><dd><p>Whether to extrude each element.
True values mean elements will be extruded, false values mean elements will remain unchanged.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Offset</dt><dd><p>The amount to translate the new geometry on each axis. The default value of the “Offset” input
is the mesh’s <a href="../../geometry/read/normal.html">normals</a>. To change the distance,
the <em>Scale</em> input can be used. However, when an input is computed for this directly, the length
of the input vectors is used.</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Because the default input is the mesh’s normals, they may need to be calculated just for this node.
If the extrusion is only in one direction anyway, a potential performance improvement is to connect
a <a href="../../input/constant/vector.html">Vector Node</a> instead.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt><dd><p>The factor used to scale elements or groups of elements.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Individual Face Mode Only</dt><dd><p>Whether to extrude each face individually rather than extruding connected groups of faces together as regions.
A quad side face will be generated on each side of every selected face.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<section id="properties">
<h2>Properties</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Mode</dt><dd><dl>
<dt>Vertices:</dt>
<dd><p>This mode is quite simple, it just attaches new edges and vertices to the selected vertices.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Edges:</dt>
<dd><p>Attach new quad faces to the selected edges. Vertices shared by the
original selected vertices are also shared in the duplicated edges.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, the normals of the new faces may be arbitrary. If the selected
edges only have one selected face, then the node can pick a consistent orientation for the
new faces, but if there is more than one connected face, or no connected faces, the normals
may have to be adjusted afterwards.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Faces:</dt>
<dd><p>Extrudes contiguous regions of selected faces, or each selected face individually,
depending on the <em>Individual</em> boolean input.</p>
<p>When the <em>Individual</em> input is false, the node will find regions of connected faces and generate
new “side” faces on the boundaries of those regions. If the whole mesh is selected and it is already
a <a href="../../../../glossary/index.html#term-Manifold">Manifold</a> shape, then result will just be that the whole mesh moves. Any vertices, edges
or faces on the <em>inside</em> of the face regions are just moved, they are not duplicated.</p>

<section id="output">
<h2>Output</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Mesh</dt><dd><p>Standard geometry output.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Top</dt><dd><p>A boolean field output containing the top new top geometry. The <a href="../../attributes_reference.html#attribute-domains">domain</a>
depends on the selected mode. In <em>Vertex</em> mode, this is a selection of the new vertices.
In <em>Edge</em> mode, this is a selection of the duplicated edges
and in <em>Face</em> mode, it is a selection of the new faces.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Side</dt><dd><p>A boolean field output containing the “side” of the new geometry. In <em>Vertex</em> mode, it selects
the new edges, in <em>Edge</em> mode, the new faces, and in <em>Face</em> mode, the new side faces are selected,
which are all of the new faces that aren’t in the <em>Top</em> selection.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Here, the selection outputs are used to set materials on certain faces of the mesh.
A <a href="../../utilities/random_value.html">Random Value Node</a> node can be used to limit the
extrusion to a random set of faces.</p>
</section>
<section id="attribute-propagation">
<h2>Attribute Propagation</h2>
<p>Attributes are transferred to the new elements with specific rules.
An attribute will never change domains on the resulting mesh.
The <code>id</code> attribute does not have any special handling.</p>
<p>Generally boolean attributes are propagated with “or”, meaning any connected
“true” value that is mixed in for other types will cause the new value
to be “true” as well.</p>
<p>The following sections describe:</p>
