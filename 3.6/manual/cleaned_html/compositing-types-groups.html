<h1>Group</h1>
<p><a href="../../interface/controls/nodes/groups.html">Group Nodes</a> are a collection of nodes
that can be combined into a single node while selectively exposing inputs of the embedded nodes.
Group nodes can simplify a node tree by allowing instancing and hiding parts of the tree.</p>
<section id="make-group">
<h2>Make Group</h2>
<p>Creates a node group from the selected nodes, see <a href="../../interface/controls/nodes/groups.html#bpy-ops-node-group-make">Make Group</a> for more information.</p>
</section>
<section id="ungroup">
<h2>Ungroup</h2>
<p>Removes the selected nodes from a group, see <a href="../../interface/controls/nodes/groups.html#bpy-ops-node-group-ungroup">Ungroup</a> for more information.</p>
</section>
<section id="group-input">
<h2>Group Input</h2>
<p>Adds a group input node, this serves as a convenient way to re-add the input node in case it is accidentally deleted.
Note, groups can only have one input, if more than one is added they are duplicates of each other.</p>
</section>
<section id="group-output">
<h2>Group Output</h2>
<p>Adds a group output node, this serves as a convenient way to re-add the output node
in case it is accidentally deleted. Note, groups can only have one output,
if more than one is added they are duplicates of each other.</p>
</section>
<section id="node-groups">
<h2>Node Groups</h2>
<p>This section lists all the node groups either from the current blend-file or
<a href="../../files/linked_libraries/link_append.html">Linked or Appended</a> from another blend-file.</p>
