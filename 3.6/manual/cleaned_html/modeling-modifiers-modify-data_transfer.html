<h1>Data Transfer Modifier</h1>
<p>The Data Transfer modifier transfers several types of data from one mesh to another.
Data types include vertex groups, UV maps, Color Attributes, custom normals…</p>
<p>Transfer works by generating a mapping between source mesh’s elements (vertices, edges, etc.)
and destination ones, either on a one-to-one basis, or mapping several source elements
to a single destination one, using interpolation.</p>

<p>If the button to the right of the field is unset, both the source and the destination geometry
is considered in global space when generating the mapping, otherwise they are evaluated
in local space (i.e. as if both object’s origins were at the same place).</p>

<section id="selection-of-data-to-transfer">
<h3>Selection of Data to Transfer</h3>
<p>To keep the size of the modifier reasonable, the kind of elements to be affected must be selected first
(vertices, edges, face corners and/or faces).</p>
<dl>
<dt>Mapping Type</dt><dd><p>How is generated the mapping between those source and destination elements. Each type has its own options,
see <a href="#geometry-mapping">Geometry Mapping</a> below for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Data Types</dt><dd><p>The left column of toggle buttons, to select which data types to transfer.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Multi-layers Data Types Options</dt><dd><p>In those cases (vertex groups, Color Attributes, UVs), one can select which source layers to transfer
(usually, either all of them, or a single specified one), and how to affect destination
(either by matching names, matching order/position,
or, if a single source is selected, by specifying manually the destination layer).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Islands Handling Refinement</dt><dd><p>This setting only affects UV transfer currently. It allows to avoid a given destination face to get
UV coordinates from different source UV islands. Keeping it at 0.0 means no island handling at all.
Typically, small values like 0.02 are enough to get good results, but if you are mapping from
a very high-poly source towards a very low-poly destination, you may have to raise it quite significantly.</p>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>First key thing to keep in mind when using this modifier is that it will <strong>not</strong> create destination data layers.
<em>Generate Data Layers</em> button shall always be used for this purpose, once the set of source data to transfer
has been selected. It should also be well understood that creating those data layers on destination mesh is <strong>not</strong>
part of the modifier stack, which means e.g. that they will remain even once the modifier is deleted, or
if the source data selection is modified.</p>
<section id="geometry-mapping">
<h3>Geometry Mapping</h3>
<p>Geometry mapping is how a given destination mesh relates to a source mesh.
In this process a destination vertex/edge/…
gets a part of the source mesh assigned with functions as its data source.
It is crucial to understand this topic well to get good results with this modifier.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Topology</dt><dd><p>The simplest option, expects both meshes to have identical number of elements, and match them by order (indices).
Useful e.g. between meshes that were identical copies, and got deformed differently.</p>
</dd>
<dt>One-To-One Mappings</dt><dd><p>Those always select only one source element for each destination one, often based on shortest distance.</p>

<dt>Face Corners</dt><dd><p>A face corner is not a real element by itself, it’s some kind of split vertex attached to a specific face.
Hence both vertex (location) and face (normal, …) aspects are used to match them together.</p>

<dt>Projected Edge Interpolated</dt><dd><p>This is a sampling process. Several rays are cast from along the destination’s edge

<dt>Face Corners</dt><dd><p>A face corner is not a real element by itself, it’s some kind of split vertex attached to a specific face.

<h3>Topology Mapping</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Max Distance</dt><dd><p>When the “pressure stylus” icon button to the right is enabled,
this is the maximum distance between source and destination to get a successful mapping.
If a destination element cannot find a source one within that range, then it will get no transferred data.</p>
<p>This allows to transfer a small sub-detailed mesh onto a more complete one
(e.g. from a “hand” mesh towards a “full body” one).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ray Radius</dt><dd><p>The starting ray radius to use when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting">Ray Casting</a>
against vertices or edges. When transferring data between meshes Blender performs a series of
ray casts to generate mappings. Blender starts with a ray with the radius defined here,
if that does not return a hit then the radius is progressively
increased until a positive hit or a limit is reached.</p>
<p>This property acts as an accuracy/performance control;
using a lower ray radius will be more accurate however,
might take longer if Blender has to progressively increase the limit.
Lower values will work better for dense meshes with lots of detail
while larger values are probably better suited for simple meshes.</p>
