<h1>Blend-Files Previews</h1>
<p>A blend-file can store previews, both for itself, and for some of its <a href="../data_blocks.html">data-blocks</a>.
You can disable writing any previews when saving a blend-file using the <em>Save Preview Images</em> setting
from the <a href="../../editors/preferences/save_load.html#prefs-save-load">Save &amp; Load</a> section of the Preferences.</p>
<section id="blend-file-preview">
<h2>Blend-File Preview</h2>
<p>Blender saves by default a small preview of current scene in the blend-file.
This will show in the <em>Thumbnail</em> view of the <a href="../../editors/file_browser.html">File Browser</a>.</p>
<p>During its installation, Blender also adds a small tool to your OS,
that will allow your system file browser to show those previews as file thumbnails as well.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-blocks-previews">
<h2>Data-Blocks Previews</h2>
<p>Blender will automatically generate previews for some type of data, mainly the ones related to shading
(like images, textures, materials, lights and world shaders).</p>
<p>It can also store previews for scenes, collections and objects, but those need to be generated manually.</p>
<p>These previews can then be used by the <em>Thumbnail</em> view of the File Browser, when linking or appending data-blocks.</p>

<p>Generate some data-block types’ previews (you can choose which in its options),
in one or more blend-files on your drive. You should not use this operator on the file currently opened in Blender.</p>
<p>This is currently the only way to generate and store in blend-files previews for scenes, collections and objects.
Note that since this involves a lot of rendering, even of small sizes, the process may take some time to complete.</p>
