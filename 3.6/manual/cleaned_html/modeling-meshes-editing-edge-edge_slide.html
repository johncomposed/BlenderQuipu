<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>By default, the position of vertices on the edge loop move as a percentage of the distance
between their original position and the adjacent edge loop, regardless of the edges’ lengths.</p>

<h3>Even Mode</h3>
<p><em>Even</em> mode keeps the shape of the selected edge loop the same as one of the edge loops adjacent to it,
rather than sliding a percentage along each perpendicular edge.</p>
<p>In <em>Even</em> mode, the tool shows the position along the length of the currently selected edge
which is marked in yellow, from the vertex that has an enlarged red marker.
Movement of the sliding edge loop is restricted to this length. As you move the mouse
the length indicator in the header changes showing where along the length of the edge you are.</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Moving the mouse moves the selected edge loop towards or away from the start vertex,
but the loop line will only move as far as the length of the currently selected edge,
conforming to the shape of one of the bounding edge loops.</p>

<section id="limitations-workarounds">
<h3>Limitations &amp; Workarounds</h3>
<p>There are restrictions on the type of edge selections that can be operated upon.
Invalid selections are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Loop Crosses Itself</dt><dd><p>This means that the tool could not find any suitable faces that were adjacent to the selected edge(s).
An example that shows this is selecting two edges that share the same face.
A face cannot be adjacent to itself.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Multiple Edge Loops</dt><dd><p>The selected edges are not in the same edge loop, which means they do not have a common edge.
You can minimize this error by always selecting edges end-to-end or in a “chain”.
If you select multiple edges just make sure they are connected.
This will decrease the possibility of getting looping errors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Border Edges</dt><dd><p>When a single edge was selected in a single-sided object.
An edge loop cannot be found because there is only one face.
Remember, edge loops are loops that span two or more faces.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A general rule of thumb is that if multiple edges are selected they should be connected end-to-end
such that they form a continuous chain. This is <em>literally</em> a general rule because you
can still select edges in a chain that are invalid because some of the edges in the chain are
in different edge loops.</p>
