<h1>Channels</h1>
<p>Channels are horizontal tracks of along the timeline that contain content called Strips.
A strip can be an image, animation, or any number of effects.
Each channel is numbered consecutively on the Y axis,
starting from 1 and allows up to 128 total channels.
The X axis of each channel represents time. Each channel can contain as many strips
as it needs along the time axis as long as they do not overlap. If a strip needs to overlap another,
it needs to be placed on a channel above or below the other strip.</p>
<section id="channel-region">
<h2>Channel Region</h2>
<p>The Channel region can be found on the left side of the timeline.
It is used to organize channels and control channels as a whole.
The visibility of this region can be toggled with View â€£ Channels</p>
