<p>Armatures mimic real skeletons. They are made out of bones, which are (by default) rigid elements.
But you have more possibilities than with real skeletons: In addition to the “natural” rotation of bones,
you can also move and even scale them! And your bones do not have to be connected to each other;
they can be completely free if you want. However,
the most natural and useful setups imply that some bones are related to others, forming so-called “chains of bones”,
which create some sort of “limbs” in your armature, as detailed in <a href="#chains-of-bones">Chains of Bones</a>.</p>
<section id="chains-of-bones">
<h2>Chains of Bones</h2>
<p>The bones inside an armature can be completely independent from each other
(i.e. the modification of one bone does not affect the others).
But this is not often a useful set up: To create a leg,
all bones “after” the thigh bone should move “with” it in a well-coordinated manner.
This is exactly what happens in armatures by parenting a bone to the next one in the limb,
you create a “chains of bones”. These chains can be ramified. For example,
five fingers attached to a single “hand” bone.</p>

<p>Bones are chained by linking the tip of the parent to the root of the child.
Root and tip can be <em>connected</em>, i.e. they are always exactly at the same point;
or they can be <em>free</em>, like in a standard parent-child object relationship.</p>
<p>A given bone can be the parent of several children,
and hence be part of several chains at the same time.</p>
<p>The bone at the beginning of a chain is called its <em>root bone</em>,
and the last bone of a chain is the <em>tip bone</em>
(do not confuse them with similar names of bones’ joints!).</p>
<p>Chains of bones are a particularly important topic in <a href="posing/index.html">posing</a>
(especially with the standard <em>forward</em> kinematics versus “automatic” <em>inverse</em> kinematics posing techniques).
You create/edit them in <em>Edit Mode</em>, but except in case of connected bones,
their relationships have no effect on bone transformations in this mode
(i.e. transforming a parent bone will not affect its children).</p>
<p>The easiest way to manage bones relationships is to use
the <a href="bones/properties/relations.html#bpy-types-editbone-parent">Relations panel</a> in the Bone tab.</p>
