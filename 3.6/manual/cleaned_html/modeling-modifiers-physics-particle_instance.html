<h1>Particle Instance Modifier</h1>
<p>When a Particle Instance modifier is added to an object,
the mesh of this object will be duplicated
at the location of the particles of the selected particle system from another target object.
This means that to use this modifier, you must have at least one other object
that has a <a href="../../../physics/particles/index.html">Particles System</a> on it.</p>
<p>Because of the correlation in which the Particle Instance modifier is
influenced by the underlying particle systems on other objects, some of the apparent effects
generated by the modifier can look and act vastly different,
depending on the underlying settings of the particle systems it is associated with.
This is worth taking account of, when it seems that the Particle Instance modifier settings
do not return the expected results.</p>

<p>Warning</p>
<p>The random algorithm used currently only ensures that relative amount to be respected <em>statistically</em>.
The actual amount of instances generated will differ from the theoretical one,
depending on the <em>Seed</em> value of the target particle system (and the <em>Offset</em> value described below, too).</p>
<p>That deviation is not significant with high number of particles,
but it will be highly noticeable with low numbers
(e.g. with 100 particles in the target system, and an <em>Amount</em> value of <code>0.1</code>,
it can generate either up to 15 or 5 instances, instead of the 10 expected).</p>

<p>If you want to fully avoid overlaps, your <em>Offset</em> value must be at least as high as your <em>Amount</em> value.</p>

<h3>Create Along Paths</h3>
<p>By default, the instances are placed depending on the particles position in the current frame.
By enabling <em>Create Along Paths</em>, the instance of the modified object follows
deforms its shape along the particle path (or the hair strand).
This allows you to select the position along the particles path regardless of the current frame.</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>You can adjust the particles’ path (using the <em>Path</em> visualization type)
on the <a href="../../../physics/particles/emitter/render.html">Render</a> panel of the <em>Particle System</em> tab.</p>

<figcaption>
<p>Particle Instance modifier example.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The render above shows a single plane mesh object assigned to two different vertex groups
and each of those vertex groups is assigned to a separate and independent particle system,
with each particle system being assigned to a different Particle Instance modifier.
In the case shown the Particle Instance modifiers are added to a sphere and a cube.
See <a href="https://archive.blender.org/wiki/uploads/4/48/Manual_-_Modifiers_-_Particle_Instance_Modifiers_-_Split_Plane.blend">example blend-file</a>.</p>
<figure id="id3">
<figcaption>
<p>Create Along Path example.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this example, a single <em>Keyed</em> particle travels through four points (green planes),
on an elliptical path. The Particle Instance modifier is added to a cylinder object
and then associated with that <em>Keyed</em> particle system.</p>
<p>When the <em>Create Along Paths</em> is activated,
instead of the cylinder location just following the position of the particle,
the cylinder mesh is fitted to the shape of the path followed by the particle.
The mesh geometry of the object which is deformed
can have an impact on how well the deformation is carried out.
In the case of the cylinder, it has many loop cuts along its length so
that it can bend at those points to deform along the particle path.</p>
<p>The Particle Instance modifier <em>Create Along Paths</em> option works for hair (strand) particles
as well as with keyed particles. In this case, the mesh of the modifier will follow
the length and profile of the hair strands paths.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Strands, when they are generated, instantly die when created, so for the <em>Create Along Paths</em> checkbox
to be of any use, you must also have the <em>Dead</em> checkbox enabled.</p>
