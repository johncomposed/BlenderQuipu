<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hair type particle system can be used for strand-like objects,
such as hair, fur, grass, quills, etc.</p>

<h2>Growing</h2>
<p>The first step is to create the hair, specifying the amount of hair strands and their lengths.</p>
<p>The complete path of the particles is calculated in advance.
So everything a particle does a hair may do also.
A hair is as long as the particle path would be for a particle with a lifetime of 100 frames.
Instead of rendering every frame of the particle animation point by point there are calculated
control points with an interpolation, the segments.</p>

<h2>Styling</h2>
<p>The next step is to style the hair. You can change the look of base hairs by changing
the <a href="../emitter/physics/index.html">Physics Settings</a>.</p>
<p>A more advanced way of changing the hair appearance is to use
<a href="../emitter/children.html">Children</a>.
This adds child hairs to the original ones, and has settings for giving them different types of shapes.</p>
<p>You can also interactively style hairs in <a href="../mode.html">Particle Edit Mode</a>.
In this mode, the particle settings become disabled, and you can comb, trim, lengthen, etc. the hair curves.</p>

<h2>Animating</h2>
<p>Hair can be made dynamic using the cloth solver.
This is covered in the <a href="dynamics.html#hair-dynamics">Hair Dynamics</a> page.</p>

<section id="rendering">
<h2>Rendering</h2>
<p>With Cycles you can render hair with specialized hair BSDFs
<a href="../../../render/shader_nodes/shader/hair.html">Hair BSDF</a> or
<a href="../../../render/shader_nodes/shader/hair_principled.html">Principled Hair BSDF</a>.</p>
<p>Hair can also be used as a basis for
the <a href="../../../modeling/modifiers/physics/particle_instance.html">Particle Instance Modifier</a>,
which allows you to have a mesh be deformed along the curves,
which is useful for thicker strands, or things like grass, or feathers, which may have a more specific look.</p>
