<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Scenes are a way to organize your work.
Each blend-file can contain multiple scenes, which share other data such as objects and materials.</p>
<p>Scene management and library appending/linking are based on Blender’s
<a href="../../files/index.html">Library and Data System</a>,
so it is a good idea to read that manual page first,
if you are not familiar with the basics of that system.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Linked Copy</dt><dd><p>This option creates a new scene with the same settings and contents as the active scene.
However, instead of copying the objects,
the new scene contains links to the collections in the old scene.
Therefore, changes to objects in the new scene will result in the same
changes to the original scene, because the objects used are literally the same.
The reverse is also true.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Full Copy</dt><dd><p>Using this option, nothing is shared.
This option creates a fully independent scene with copies of the active scene’s contents.
Every object in the original scene is duplicated, and a duplicate,
private copy of its object-data is made as well.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>To choose between these options,
it is useful to understand the difference between <em>Object</em> and <em>Object Data</em>.
The choices for adding a scene, therefore, determine just how much of this information will be
<em>copied from</em> the active scene to the new one, and how much will be <em>shared</em> (linked).</p>
