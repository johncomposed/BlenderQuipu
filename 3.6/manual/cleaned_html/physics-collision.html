<p>If you change the deflection settings for an object you have to recalculate the particle,
soft body or cloth system by <em>Delete Bake</em>, this is not done automatically.</p>
<p>A collider object can be temporarily disabled via an animatable toggle to
the right of the button that permanently activates or deactivates it.</p>

<dt>Field Absorption</dt><dd><p>A deflector can also deflect effectors. You can specify some collision/deflector objects which deflect
a specific portion of the effector force using the <em>Field Absorption</em> value. 100% absorption results in no force
getting through the collision/deflector object at all. If you have three collision object behind each other with
e.g. 10%, 43% and 3%, the absorption ends up at around 50% \(100 × (1 - 0.1) × (1 - 0.43) × (1 - 0.03)\).</p>

<h3>Soft Body and Cloth</h3>
<p>It is also important to note that this collision panel is used to tell
all simulations that this object is to participate in colliding/deflecting other objects
on a shared layer (particles, soft bodies, and cloth).</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The object’s shape deforms the cloth,
so the cloth simulation must be inputted the “true” shape of that mesh object at that frame.
This true shape is the basis shape as modified by shape keys or armatures. Therefore,
the Collision Modifier must be <strong>after</strong> any of those.
The image to the right shows the <em>Modifiers</em> panel for the Character mesh object
(not the cloth object).</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p><em>Soft body</em> collisions are difficult to get perfect.
If one of the objects move too fast, the soft body will penetrate the mesh.

<section id="hints">
<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure that the normals of the mesh surface are facing towards the particles/points
for correct deflection. Negative scales on the object can have a similar effect.
Make sure to recalculate the normals after applying the scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Hair particles react directly to force fields,
so if you use a force field with a short range you do not need necessarily collision.</p></li>
<li><p>Hair particles avoid their emitting mesh if you edit them in <em>Particle Edit Mode</em>.
So you can at least model the hair with collision.</p></li>
