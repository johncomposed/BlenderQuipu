<dt>Auto Normalize</dt><dd><p>Ensures that all deforming vertex groups add up to one while painting.
When this option is turned off, then all weights of a point can have any value between 0 and 1.
However, when vertex groups are used as deform groups for character animation
then Blender always interprets the weight values relative to each other.
That is, Blender always does a normalization over all deform bones.
Hence in practice it is not necessary to maintain a strict normalization and
further normalizing weights should not affect animation at all.</p>
<p>This option works most intuitively when used to maintain normalization while
painting on top of weights that are already normalized with another tool.</p>
