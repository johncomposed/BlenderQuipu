<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Rather than storing offsets directly, internally relative keys are stored as snapshots of the mesh shape.
The relative deformation offsets are computed by subtracting <em>Reference Key</em> from that snapshot.</p>
<p>Therefore, replacing the <em>Reference Key</em> has the effect of subtracting the difference between the new
and old reference from the relative deformation of the current key.</p>
