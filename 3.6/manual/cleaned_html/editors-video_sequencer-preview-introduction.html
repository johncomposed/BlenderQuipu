<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Sequencer preview is used to display result of rendering Sequencer timeline.
This can be further configured to display output from certain channel, overlay or image analyzer (scope).</p>
<p>The Preview contains two regions (see figure 1), the Header is shown
in a yellow outline with the <em>Preview</em> (red outline) underneath.
This Preview has no fixed dimensions; you can zoom in or move indefinitely.
However, in figure 1 you see a checkered area (green outline).
This preview has the aspect ratio of the Project Dimensions; e.g. 1920 x 1080 pixels in figure 1.
But, because the source strip could be scaled in a different resolution,
the yellow outline shows the area that the source strip occupies.
As you can see, the Open movie “Spring” has a different resolution than
the project and letterboxes are added at the top and bottom of the image.</p>
<p>In contrast with the <a href="../sequencer/index.html">Sequencer View</a> example,
both the Toolbar and Sidebar are expanded in figure 1.
The gizmos however are unique for the Preview.</p>
