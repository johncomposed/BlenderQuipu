<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, materials and lights.
In this part, the first of these is covered, that being modeling.
Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a surface that either mimics the shape
of a real-world object or expresses your imagination of abstract objects.</p>
<section id="modes">
<h2>Modes</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of object you are trying to model, there are different types
of modeling <a href="../editors/3dview/modes.html">modes</a>.
Since modes are not specific to modeling they are covered in different parts of the manual.</p>
<p>Switching between modes while modeling is common.
Some tools may be available in more than one mode while others may be unique to a particular mode.</p>
<section id="edit-mode">
<h3>Edit Mode</h3>
<p>Edit Mode is the main mode where modeling takes place.
Edit Mode is used to edit the following types of objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Meshes</p></li>
<li><p>Curves</p></li>
<li><p>Surfaces</p></li>
<li><p>Metaballs</p></li>
<li><p>Text objects</p></li>
<li><p>Lattice</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can only modify the mesh of the objects you are editing.
To modify other objects you can leave Edit Mode, select another object and enter Edit Mode,
or use <a href="../editors/3dview/modes.html#dview-multi-object-mode">Multi-Object Editing</a>.</p>
