<h2>Ray Types</h2>
<p>Ray types can be divided into four categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Camera: the ray comes straight from the camera.</p></li>
<li><p>Reflection: the ray is generated by a reflection off a surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Transmission: the ray is generated by a transmission through a surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Shadow: the ray is used for (transparent) shadows.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Reflection and transmission rays can further have these properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Diffuse: the ray is generated by a diffuse reflection or transmission (translucency).</p></li>
<li><p>Glossy: the ray is generated by a glossy specular reflection or transmission.</p></li>
<li><p>Singular: the ray is generated by a perfectly sharp reflection or transmission.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Light Path node can be used to find out the type of ray the shading is being computed for.</p>

<section id="bounce-control">
<h2>Bounce Control</h2>
<p>The maximum number of light bounces can be controlled manually.
While ideally this should be infinite,
in practice a smaller number of bounces may be sufficient,
or some light interactions may be intentionally left out for faster convergence.
The number of diffuse reflection,
glossy reflection and transmission bounces can also be controlled individually.</p>
<p>Light paths are terminated probabilistically when specifying a minimum number of light bounces
lower than the maximum. In that case, paths longer than minimum will be randomly stopped when
they are expected to contribute less light to the image.
This will still converge to the same image, but renders faster while possibly being noisier.</p>
</section>
<section id="transparency">
<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>The transparent <abbr title="Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function">BSDF</abbr> shader is given
special treatment. When a ray passes through it, light passes straight on,
as if there was no geometry there.
The ray type does not change when passing through a transparent BSDF.</p>
<p>Alpha pass output is also different for the transparent BSDF.
Other transmission BSDFs are considered opaque,
because they change the light direction. As such they cannot be used for
alpha-over compositing, while this is possible with the transparent BSDF.</p>
<p>Note that, while semantically the ray passes through as if no geometry was hit,
rendering performance is affected as each transparency step requires executing the shader and tracing a ray.</p>

<h3>Clamping</h3>
<dl id="bpy-types-cyclesrendersettings-sample-clamp-direct">
<dt>Direct Light</dt><dd><p>This option limits the maximum intensity a sample from rays which have not yet bounced can contribute to a pixel.
It reduces noise at the cost of accuracy. Setting this option to 0.0 disables clamping altogether.

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>This option provides a way to limit <a href="../../../glossary/index.html#term-Fireflies">Fireflies</a>. However, note that as you clamp out such values,
other bright lights/reflections will be dimmed as well.</p>
<p>Care must be taken when using this setting to find a balance between mitigating fireflies and
losing intentionally bright parts. It is often useful to clamp indirect bounces separately,
as they tend to cause more fireflies than direct bounces. See the <em>Clamp Indirect</em> setting.</p>

<dl id="bpy-types-cyclesrendersettings-blur-glossy">
<dt>Filter Glossy</dt><dd><p>When using a value higher than 0.0, this will blur glossy reflections after blurry bounces,
to reduce noise at the cost of accuracy. 1.0 is a good starting value to tweak.</p>
<p>Some light paths have a low probability of being found while contributing much light to the pixel.
As a result these light paths will be found in some pixels and not in others, causing <a href="../../../glossary/index.html#term-Fireflies">Fireflies</a>.
An example of such a difficult path might be a small light that is causing a small specular highlight
on a sharp glossy material, which is observed through a rough glossy material.
In fact in such a case there practically occurs a caustic.</p>
<p>With path tracing it is difficult to find the specular highlight,
but if you increase the roughness on the material, the highlight gets bigger and softer, and so easier to find.
Often this blurring will hardly be noticeable, because it is blurred by the material anyway,
but there are also cases where this will lead to a loss of detail in lighting.</p>
