<p>OBJ format is a popular plain text format, however, it has only basic geometry and material support.</p>

<p>Note</p>
<p>There is no support for armatures, lights, cameras, empty objects, parenting, or transformations.
See <a href="#compatibility">Compatibility</a> for more information.</p>

<dt>Scale</dt><dd><p>Global scale to use on export.</p>

<dt>Forward Axis, Up Axis</dt><dd><p>Since many applications use a different axis for ‘Up’, there are axis conversion settings,
Forward and Up axis – By mapping these to different axis you can convert rotations
between applications default up and forward axis.</p>
<p>Blender uses Y Forward, Z Up (since the front view looks along the +Y direction).
For example, its common for applications to use Y as the up axis, in that case -Z Forward, Y Up is needed.</p>

<a href="../../modeling/modifiers/index.html">Modifiers</a> have been calculated.</p>

One example where this is important is the <a href="../../modeling/modifiers/generate/subdivision_surface.html">Subdivision Surface Modifier</a>.</p>

<dt>Normals</dt><dd><p>Write out Blender’s face and vertex normals (depending on the faces smooth setting).</p>
<p>Mostly this isn’t needed since most applications will calculate their
own normals but to match Blender’s normal map textures you will need to write these too.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Colors</dt><dd><p>Write out the active vertex colors attribute layer, if present. Colors are exported in
“xyzrgb” OBJ extension format.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Path Mode</dt><dd><p>When referencing paths in exported files you may want some control as to the method used since absolute paths
may only be correct on your own system. Relative paths, on the other hand, are more portable
but mean that you have to keep your files grouped when moving about on your local file system.
In some cases, the path doesn’t matter since the target application will search
a set of predefined paths anyway so you have the option to strip the path too.</p>

absolute for any directories outside that.</p>
