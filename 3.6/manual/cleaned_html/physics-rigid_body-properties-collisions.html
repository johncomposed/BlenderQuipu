<dl id="bpy-types-rigidbodyobject-collision-shape">
<dt>Shape</dt><dd><p>Determines the collision shape of the object;
these can be broken into two categories: primitive shapes and mesh based shapes.</p>
<p>Primitive shapes (<em>Box</em>, <em>Sphere</em>, <em>Capsule</em>, <em>Cylinder</em>, and <em>Cone</em>)
are best in terms of memory and performance but do not
necessarily reflect the actual shape of the object.
They are calculated based on the object’s bounding box.
The center of gravity is always in the geometric center of the shape.
Primitive shapes can be shown in the 3D Viewport by enabling <a href="../../../scene_layout/object/properties/display.html#bpy-types-object-show-bounds">Bounds</a>.</p>
<p>Mesh based shapes (<em>Convex Hull</em> and <em>Mesh</em>) are calculated based on the geometry of the object
so they are a better representation of the object.
The center of gravity for these shapes is the object origin.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Box:</dt>
<dd><p>Box-like shapes (e.g. cubes), including planes (e.g. ground planes).
The size per axis is calculated from the bounding box.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sphere:</dt>
<dd><p>Sphere-like shapes. The radius is the largest axis of the bounding box.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Capsule:</dt>
<dd><p>This points up the Z axis.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cylinder:</dt>
<dd><p>This points up the Z axis.
The height is taken from the Z axis, while the radius is the larger of the X or Y axes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cone:</dt>
<dd><p>This points up the Z axis.
The height is taken from the Z axis, while the radius is the larger of the X or Y axes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Convex Hull:</dt>
<dd><p>A mesh-like surface encompassing (e.g. shrink-wrapped over) all vertices (best results with fewer vertices).
A convex approximation of the object, which has good performance and stability.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mesh:</dt>
<dd><p><a href="../../../glossary/index.html#term-Mesh">Mesh</a> consisting of triangles only, allowing for more detailed interactions than convex hulls.
Allows simulating concave objects, but is rather slow and unstable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Compound Parent:</dt>
<dd><p>Takes the collision shapes from the object’s <a href="../../../scene_layout/object/editing/parent.html">children</a>
and combines them. This makes it possible to create concave shapes from primitive shapes.
This usually results in a faster simulation than the <em>Mesh</em> collision shape
while also being generally more stable.</p>

<h2>Sensitivity</h2>
<p>The collision margin is used to improve the performance and stability of rigid bodies.
Depending on the shape, it behaves differently: some shapes embed it,
while others have a visible gap around them.</p>
<p>The margin is <em>embedded</em> for these shapes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sphere</p></li>
<li><p>Box</p></li>
<li><p>Capsule</p></li>
<li><p>Cylinder</p></li>
<li><p>Convex Hull: Only allows for uniform scale when embedded.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The margin is <em>not embedded</em> for these shapes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cone</p></li>
<li><p>Active Triangle Mesh</p></li>
<li><p>Passive Triangle Mesh: Can be set to 0 most of the time.</p></li>
