<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Mesh Modeling typically begins with
a <a href="primitives.html">Mesh Primitive</a> shape (e.g. circle, cube, cylinderâ€¦).
From there you might begin editing to create a larger, more complex shape.</p>
<section id="modeling-modes">
<h2>Modeling Modes</h2>
<p>The 3D Viewport has three principal modes that allow for the creation,
editing and manipulation of the mesh models.
Each of the three modes has a variety of tools. Some tools may be found in one or more of the modes.</p>
<p>Modes that used for modeling:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Object Mode</dt><dd><p>Supports basic operations such as object creation,
joining objects, managing shape keys, UV/color layers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Edit Mode</dt><dd><p>Used for the majority of mesh editing operations.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>Instead of dealing with individual mesh elements,
supports sculpting with brushes <em>(not covered in this chapter)</em>.</p>
