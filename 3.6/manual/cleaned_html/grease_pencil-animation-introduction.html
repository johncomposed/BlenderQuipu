<h2>Animating with Grease Pencil</h2>
<p>The main goal of Grease Pencil is to offer a 2D animation tool full immersed in a 3D environment.</p>
<figure id="id1">

<p>In Blender, Grease Pencil objects can be animated in many ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Moving as a whole object</dt><dd><p>Changing their position, orientation or size in time;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Drawing frame by frame</dt><dd><p>Drawing one frame at a time (traditional animation).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Deforming them</dt><dd><p>Animating their points;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inherited animation</dt><dd><p>Causing the object to move based on the movement of another object
(e.g. its parent, hook, armature, etc.). Useful for cut-out animation for example.</p>
</dd>

<h2>2D Traditional Animation</h2>
<section id="keyframes">
<h3>Keyframes</h3>
<p>Traditional animation in Grease Pencil is achieved with the use of
<a href="../../animation/keyframes/introduction.html">keyframes</a>
that hold the strokes information at a particular frame or frame range.</p>
<p>With <a href="../../editors/timeline.html#bpy-types-toolsettings-use-keyframe-insert-auto">Auto keyframe</a> activated,
every time you create a stroke in Grease Pencil object Draw Mode
a new keyframe is added at the current frame on the active channel.
With Auto keyframe deactivated, you will have to add manually
a new keyframe or your new strokes will be added on the active keyframe.</p>
<p>See <a href="../../animation/keyframes/editing.html">Keyframe Editing</a> for more information.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The channels in the Dope Sheet correspond to the active 2D layer of the Grease Pencil object.</p>
</div>
<p>Grease Pencil has its own mode in the Dope Sheet to work with keyframes.
See Grease Pencil mode in the <a href="../../editors/dope_sheet/grease_pencil.html">Dope Sheet</a>
section for more information.
There are also several tools on the Stroke menu to work with keyframes and strokes.
See <a href="tools.html">Animation tools</a> for more information.</p>
</section>
<section id="onion-skinning">
<h3>Onion Skinning</h3>
<p>One key element in traditional animation is the use of onion skinning.
Grease Pencil offer a lot of flexibility and options for this tool.
See <a href="../properties/onion_skinning.html">Onion Skinning</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Animation Options</h2>
<section id="draw-mode">
<h3>Draw Mode</h3>
<p>In Draw Mode there are three options related to the animation workflow that you can use.</p>

<dt>Add Weight Data</dt><dd><p>When enabled, new strokes weight data is added according to the current vertex group and weights.
If there is no vertex group selected, no weight data is added.</p>
<p>This is useful for example in cut-out animation for adding new drawing
on the same vertex group without the need to creating it afterwards.</p>
<p>See <a href="../modes/weight_paint/introduction.html">Weight Paint Mode</a> for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Additive Drawing</dt><dd><p>When creating new frames, the strokes from the previous/active frame are include as a basis for the new one.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Multiframe</dt><dd><p>If you need to add new strokes to your animation on several frames you can use multiframe drawing.</p>
<p>You can activate multiframe drawing with the Multiframe button next to the modes selector (faded lines icon).
See <a href="../multiframe.html">Multiframe</a> for more information.</p>

<dt>Multiframe</dt><dd><p>Sometimes you may need to modify several frames at the same time with edit tools,
for example to repositioning drawings in an animation.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<section id="traditional-animation">
<h3>Traditional Animation</h3>
<p>This example shows you how to animate a bouncing ball
with a traditional 2D animation technique and Grease Pencil.</p>
<p>First, go to menu File ‣ New ‣ 2D Animation to start with a new 2D animation template.
The template is ready to quick start your animation with a Grease Pencil object already created,
Onion Skinning activated, Auto Keyframe enabled and in camera view.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Set the range of the animation in the Timeline from 1 to 24.</p></li>
<li><p>In the 3D Viewport draw a ball on the upper left corner with the Draw Tool (extreme).</p></li>
<li><p>Move to frame 12 and draw a squashed ball in the bottom center (breakdown).</p></li>
<li><p>Move to frame 24 and draw a ball in the top right corner of the 3D Viewport (extreme).</p></li>
<li><p>Keep drawing all the in-between frames you want using the onion skinning ghost as a reference.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To test the animation, press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> to play.</p>
