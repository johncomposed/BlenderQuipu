<h1>Regions</h1>
<p>Every Editor in Blender is divided into Regions.
Regions can have smaller structuring elements like
<a href="tabs_panels.html">tabs and panels</a>
with buttons, controls and widgets placed within them.</p>

<section id="main-region">
<h2>Main Region</h2>
<p>At least one region is always visible.
It is called the Main region and is the most prominent part of the editor.</p>
<p>Each editor has a specific purpose, so the main region and
the availability of additional regions are different between editors.
See specific documentation about each editor in the <a href="../../editors/index.html">Editors</a> chapter.</p>
</section>
<section id="header">
<h2>Header</h2>
<p>A header is a small horizontal strip, which sits either at the top or bottom of an area.
All editors have a header acting as a container for menus and commonly used tools.
<a href="../controls/buttons/menus.html#ui-header-menu">Menus</a> and buttons will change with the editor type and
the selected object and mode.</p>

<section id="context-menu">
<h3>Context Menu</h3>
<p><kbd>RMB</kbd> on a header reveals a context menu with a couple options:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Show Header</dt><dd><p>Toggles the visibility of the header.
If a header is hidden, it can be made visible again by clicking or dragging
the small arrow that appears at the top/bottom right of the editor.</p>

<dt>Flip to Bottom/Top</dt><dd><p>Toggles whether the header or Tool Settings appear on the top or bottom of the editor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vertical/Horizontal Split</dt><dd><p>Shows an indicator line that lets you select the area and position where to split.

</section>
<section id="toolbar">
<h2>Toolbar</h2>
<p>The <a href="../tool_system.html#ui-region-toolbar">Toolbar</a> (on the left side of the editor area)
contains a set of interactive tools. <kbd>T</kbd> toggles the visibility of the Toolbar.</p>
</section>
<section id="tool-settings">
<h2>Tool Settings</h2>
<p>A horizontal strip at the top or bottom of the editor (similar to the header)
containing settings for the currently selected tool. Just like the header,
it can be hidden and moved through its context menu.</p>
</section>
<section id="adjust-last-operation">
<h2>Adjust Last Operation</h2>
<p><a href="../undo_redo.html#bpy-ops-screen-redo-last">Adjust Last Operation</a> is a region that allows
tweaking an operator after running it. For example, if you just added a cube,
you can use this region to tweak its size.</p>
</section>
<section id="sidebar">
<h2>Sidebar</h2>
<p>The <em>Sidebar</em> (on the right side of the editor area)
contains <a href="tabs_panels.html#ui-panels">Panels</a>
with settings of objects within the editor and the editor itself.
<kbd>N</kbd> toggles the visibility of the Sidebar.</p>
</section>
<section id="footer">
<h2>Footer</h2>
<p>Some editors show a bar (on top/bottom of the editor area)
that displays information about for example the active tool or operator.</p>
</section>
<section id="arranging">
<h2>Arranging</h2>
<section id="scrolling">
<h3>Scrolling</h3>
<p>A region can be scrolled vertically and/or horizontally by dragging it with the <kbd>MMB</kbd>.
If the region has no zoom level, it can also be scrolled by using the <kbd>Wheel</kbd>
while the mouse hovers over it.</p>
<p id="interface-window-system-regions-scroll-range">Some regions, in particular animation timelines, have scrollbars with added control points
to adjust the vertical or horizontal range of the region.
These special scrollbars will have added widgets at the ends, as shown in the following image:</p>
<figure id="id3">
<figcaption>
<p>Scrollbars with zoom widgets.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This can be used to stretch or compress the range to show more or less detail within the available screen space.
Simply drag one of the dots to either increase or decrease the displayed range.
You can also quickly adjust both the horizontal and vertical range by dragging in the editor with <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>MMB</kbd></kbd>.</p>
</section>
<section id="changing-the-size-and-hiding">
<h3>Changing the Size and Hiding</h3>
<p>Resizing regions works by dragging their border, the same way as
<a href="areas.html">Areas</a>.</p>
<p>To hide a region, resize it down to nothing.
A hidden region leaves a little arrow sign.
<kbd>LMB</kbd> on this icon to make the region reappear.</p>

<section id="scaling">
<h3>Scaling</h3>
<p>The scale of certain regions (such as the Toolbar) can be changed by dragging inside them
with <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>MMB</kbd></kbd>, or using <kbd>NumpadPlus</kbd> and <kbd>NumpadMinus</kbd> while hovering the
mouse cursor over them. Press <kbd>Home</kbd> to reset the scale to the default.</p>
