<dt>Target</dt><dd><p><a href="../../../interface/controls/templates/data_block.html#ui-data-id">Data ID</a> used to select the constraints target, and is not functional (red state) when it has none.

<dt>Remove Target Shear</dt><dd><p>Removes shearing from the target transformation after the target space conversion,
ensuring it consists purely of translation, rotation and scale.
Note that <a href="copy_rotation.html">Copy Rotation</a> always does this.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mix</dt><dd><p>Specifies how the copied transformation is combined with the existing transformation.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Replace</dt><dd><p>The new transformation replaces the existing transformation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Before/After Original (Full)</dt><dd><p>The new transformation is added before/after the existing transformation, as if it was
applied to an imaginary parent/child of the constraint owner. Scale is handled like in
the most basic <a href="../../armatures/bones/properties/relations.html#bpy-types-editbone-inherit-scale">Full Inherit Scale</a> mode of bones,
so combining non-uniform scale and rotation will create shear.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Before/After Original (Aligned)</dt><dd><p>The new transformation is added before/after the existing transformation, as if it was
applied to an imaginary parent/child of the constraint owner. Scale is handled like in
the <a href="../../armatures/bones/properties/relations.html#bpy-types-editbone-inherit-scale">Aligned Inherit Scale</a> mode of bones to
avoid creating shear.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to using the <em>Split Channels</em> option, but replacing the location component with
the result of <em>Full</em>. If only uniform scale is used, the result is identical to <em>Full</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Before/After Original (Split Channels)</dt><dd><p>Combines location, rotation and scale components of the transformation separately, similar
to a sequence of three <a href="copy_location.html">Copy Location</a>,
<a href="copy_rotation.html">Copy Rotation</a> and
<a href="copy_scale.html">Copy Scale</a> (with Offset)
constraints bundled together in one operation; the result may be slightly different
in case of sheared inputs.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Aligned</em>, in this mode location channels are simply added together, so rotation
and scale components of the input transformations cannot affect the resulting location.</p>
