<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Use the “Create Sculpting Plane” button for an optimal startign setup for sculpting your own VDM brush.</p>
<p>Use the “Render and Create VDM Brush” button to covnert bake the plane into a new brush.
The brush will be added with all relevant options and a vector displacement map
is saved near the blender file as an Open EXR file (or a ‘tmp’ folder if the blender file wasn’t saved).
New brushes can be found as Draw brushes in sculpt mode.
The add-on won’t create any preview images for these brushes.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>While Sculpting make sure to mask the borders of the plane for a better result.</p></li>
<li><p>If your VDM brush gets cut off at the corners, you can increase the size inside the texture panel of the brush settings to 1.1 or 1.2 for each axis.</p></li>
<li><p>A vdm-resolution of 512 px or lower is usually enough. Unless you have extremely detailed sculptings</p></li>
