<h1>The Blender Community</h1>
<p>Being freely available from the start, even while it was closed source, considerably helped Blender’s adoption by the
community. A large, stable, and active community of users has gathered around Blender since 1998. The community showed
its support for Blender in 2002 when they helped raise €100,000 in seven weeks to enable Blender to go Open Source
under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL License</a>.</p>
<section id="independent-sites">
<h2>Independent Sites</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.blender.org/community/">several independent websites</a>
such as forums, blogs, news, and tutorial sites dedicated to Blender.</p>
<p>One of the largest community forums is <a href="https://blenderartists.org/">Blender Artists</a>,
where Blender users gather to show off their creations,
get feedback, ask and offer help and, in general, discuss Blender.</p>

<h2>Getting Support</h2>
<p>Blender’s community is one of its greatest features, so apart from this user manual,
there are many different ways to get support from other users, such as <a href="#blender-chat">Blender Chat</a>,
<a href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>For studios and organizations there is <a href="https://www.blender.org/support/">Enterprise support</a>,
and for studios looking to add Blender to their pipeline, <a href="https://studio.blender.org/">Blender Studio</a>
contains documentation and training material around this topic.
