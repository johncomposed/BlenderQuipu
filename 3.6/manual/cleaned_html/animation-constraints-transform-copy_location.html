<p>Note that if you use such a constraint on a <em>connected</em> bone, it will have
no effect, as it is the parent’s tip which controls the position of your

<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>Let us animate a solar system with the <em>Copy Location</em> constraint and its <em>Offset</em> option.
You can make the owner, called “moon”, describe perfect circles centered on the world origin
(using e.g. <em>Location X/Y</em> sine and cosine F-Curves, see <a href="../../../editors/graph_editor/fcurves/modifiers.html#bpy-types-fmodifierfunctiongenerator">Built-in Function Modifier</a>).
Then copy the location of a target “earth” with the <em>Offset</em> checkbox enabled
to model a satellite in a (simplified) orbit around its planet.
Repeat these steps for more planets circling around its center star “sun”.</p>
<p>Following video is a small animation of a solar system created using (among a few others)
the previously described technique:</p>
<p>Note that, this ‘solar’ system is not realistic at all
(the wrong scale, the earth is rotating in the wrong direction around the sun, …).</p>
<p>You can download
the <a href="https://archive.blender.org/wiki/index.php/File:ManAnimationTechsUsingConstraintsExSolarSys.blend">blend-file</a>
used to create this animation.</p>
<p>Furthermore you can also animate a few properties of each constraint using animation curves:
e.g. you can animate the <em>Influence</em> of a constraint.
It is used to first let the camera follow the moon, then the earth,
and finally using two <em>Copy Location</em> constraints with <em>Offset</em> set.</p>
