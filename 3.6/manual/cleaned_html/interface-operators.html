<h1>Operators</h1>
<p>Operators execute an action the moment they’re activated,
which makes them different from tools (which require some sort of input).
Operators can be started from <a href="controls/buttons/buttons.html#ui-operator-buttons">Operator Buttons</a>,
<a href="controls/buttons/menus.html#ui-header-menu">Header Menus</a>, or <a href="controls/templates/operator_search.html#bpy-ops-wm-search-menu">Menu Search</a>.
Examples of operators include adding a new object,
deleting it, or setting its shading to smooth.</p>
<section id="operator-properties">
<h2>Operator Properties</h2>
<p>Most operators have properties that can be adjusted to refine their result.
First run the operator (which will use its default settings),
then adjust the properties in the <a href="undo_redo.html#bpy-ops-screen-redo-last">Adjust Last Operation</a> region.</p>

<section id="modal-operators">
<h2>Modal Operators</h2>
<p>Modal operators exist as a concept in between <a href="tool_system.html">Tools</a>
and regular operators.
They require some sort of interactive input.</p>
<p>The action of a modal operator can be confirmed using <kbd>LMB</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd>.
To cancel a modal operator use <kbd>RMB</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</p>
<section id="slider-operators">
<h3>Slider Operators</h3>
<p>Slider operators are used to interactively adjust a percentage value
in the editor’s <a href="window_system/regions.html#ui-region-header">Header</a>.</p>
<p>You can adjust the percentage by dragging the slider left or right.
This can be made coarser (snapping in 10% increments) by holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
and more precise by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>.
For some sliders, you can toggle “overshoot” with <kbd>E</kbd>, which lets
you go beyond the 0-100% range.</p>
