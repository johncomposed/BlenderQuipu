<p>The Dope Sheet View is used to visualize motion tracking data,
it is implemented as separate view of the Movie Clip editor just like the Graph View.</p>
<p>It displays channels for selected tracks and each channel visualizes tracked
segments of tracks as dark bars and keyframed positions of tracks as small diamonds.</p>
<p>The background is highlighted depending on the number of tracks in a frame.
This means that if for a frame (or sequence of frames) there are less than eight tracks,
the background will turn red;
if there are from eight to sixteen tracks, the background will be yellow.</p>
<p>This is only a visual feedback, which doesn’t mean that the camera motion will not
reconstruct with less than eight tracks. It only means that you should pay attention to those frames and
check if all possible good feature points are tracked there. Remember, if there are no good feature points in
the frame and there are less than 16 tracks in the frame, it doesn’t mean the solution won’t be accurate.
Rather, adding more tracks on bad feature points will reduce the accuracy of solution.</p>
