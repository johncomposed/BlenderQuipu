<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Modifiers are automatic operations that affect an object’s geometry in a non-destructive way.
With modifiers, you can perform many effects automatically that would otherwise be too tedious to do manually
(such as subdivision surfaces) and without affecting the base geometry of your object.</p>
<p>They work by changing how an object is displayed and rendered, but not the geometry which you can edit directly.
You can add several modifiers to a single object to form <a href="#the-modifier-stack">The Modifier Stack</a>
and <em>Apply</em> a modifier if you wish to make its changes permanent.</p>

<p>They can be added to the active object using the <em>Add Modifier</em> drop-down menu at the top of their properties tab.
New modifiers are always added at the bottom of the <a href="#modifier-stack">stack</a> (i.e. will be applied last).</p>
<p>There are four categories of modifiers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Modify</dt><dd><p>These are tools similar to the <em>Deform</em> ones (see below),
however, they usually do not directly affect the geometry of the object,
but some other data, such as vertex groups.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Generate</dt><dd><p>These are constructive/destructive tools that will affect the whole <a href="../../glossary/index.html#term-Topology">Topology</a> of the mesh.
They can change the general appearance of the object, or add new geometry to it…</p>
</dd>
<dt>Deform</dt><dd><p>Unlike <em>Generate</em> ones above, these only change the shape of an object, without altering its topology.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Simulate</dt><dd><p>Those represent <a href="../../physics/index.html">physics simulations</a>. In most cases, they are automatically added to
the modifiers stack whenever a <em>Particle System</em> or <em>Physics</em> simulation is enabled. Their only role is to define
the position in the modifier stack from which is taken the base data for the simulation they represent.
As such, they typically have no attributes, and are controlled by settings exposed in
separate sections of the <a href="../../editors/properties_editor.html">Properties</a>.</p>

<section id="the-modifier-stack">
<h3>The Modifier Stack</h3>
<p>Modifiers are a series of non-destructive operations which can be applied on top of an object’s geometry.
You can be apply them in almost any order.
This kind of functionality is often referred to as a “modifier stack”
and is also found in several other 3D applications.</p>
<p>In a modifier stack, the order in which modifiers are applied has an effect on the result.
Therefore the modifiers can be re-arranged by clicking the grab widget (<code>::::</code>) in the top right,
and moving the selected modifier up or down.
For example, the image below shows <a href="generate/subdivision_surface.html">Subdivision Surface</a>
and <a href="generate/mirror.html">Mirror</a> modifiers that have switched places.</p>
<table id="id3">
<caption>Modifier Stack example.</caption>
<tbody>
<tr><td><figure id="id4">
<figcaption>
<p>The Mirror modifier is the last item in the stack and
the result looks like two surfaces.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</td>
<td><figure id="id5">
<figcaption>
<p>The Subdivision Surface modifier is the last
item in the stack and the result is a single merged surface.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Modifiers are calculated from top to bottom in the stack.
In this example, the desired result (on right) is achieved by first mirroring the object,
and then calculating the subdivision surface.</p>
<section id="active-modifier">
<h4>Active Modifier</h4>
<p>A modifier in the stack can be selected to mark in as <a href="../../glossary/index.html#term-Active">Active</a>,
the active modifier displays an outline around the modifier’s panel.
To set an active modifier, select an area of the modifier’s panel background,
the modifier’s icon, or, select a modifier in the <a href="../../editors/outliner/index.html">Outliner</a>.</p>
<p>The active modifier is used by the <a href="../../editors/geometry_node.html">Geometry Node Editor</a>
to determine which node group is being modified.</p>
