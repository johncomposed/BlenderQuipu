<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Constraints are a way to control an object’s properties
(e.g. its location, rotation, scale), using either plain static values
(like the <a href="transform/limit_location.html">“limit” ones</a>),
or another object, called “target”
(like e.g. the <a href="transform/copy_location.html">“copy” ones</a>).</p>
<p>Even though constraints are useful in static projects,
their main usage is obviously in animation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can control an object’s animation through the targets used by its constraints
(this is a form of indirect animation). Indeed,
these targets can then control the constraint’s owner’s properties, and hence,
animating the targets will indirectly animate the owner.</p></li>
<li><p>You can animate constraints’ settings. e.g. the <em>Influence</em> or
when using an armature’s bone as target,
animate where along this bone (between root and tip) lays the real target point.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They can make the eyes of a tennis player track a tennis ball bouncing across the court,
allow the wheels on a bus to all rotate together,
help a dinosaur’s legs bend at the knee automatically, and
make it easy for a hand to grip the hilt of a sword and the sword to swing with the hand.</p>
<p>Constraints, in Blender, work with <a href="../../glossary/index.html#term-Object">Objects</a> and <a href="../../glossary/index.html#term-Bone">Bones</a>.
Read about using constraints in rigging
in the <a href="../armatures/posing/bone_constraints/index.html">Armature chapter</a>.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Constraints are a fantastic way to add sophistication and complexity to a rig.</p>
<p>But be careful not to rush in too quickly, piling up constraint upon constraint
until you lose all sense of how they interact with each other.</p>
<p>Start simply. Get to know a single constraint inside and out.
<a href="transform/copy_location.html">Copy Location Constraint</a> is a good first constraint to explore it
also has an animation example. Take the time to understand every fundamental concept behind it,
and the other constraints will make far more sense.</p>
