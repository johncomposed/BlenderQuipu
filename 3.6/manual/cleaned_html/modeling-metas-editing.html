<h1>Editing</h1>
<p>In addition to having several meta objects in a same family,
you can also have several meta primitives in a single object (just add some more while in Edit Mode).
Each will be an element, with its own shape, editing rings (in the viewport), and settings.</p>

<h2>Object Families</h2>
<p>A “family” is a way to regroup several meta objects,
producing something very similar to having several metas inside the same object.</p>
<p>It is defined by the left part of an object’s name (the one before the first dot).
Remember, an object’s name is the one in the <em>Object Name</em> field, in most panels,
<strong>not</strong> the <em>Metaball Name</em> field, which is the meta data-block’s name…
For example, the <em>family</em> part of “MetaPlane.001” is <code>MetaPlane</code>.
Each meta object in the same “family” is associated with one another as discussed below.</p>
<figure id="id2">
<figcaption>

</figure>
<p>Families of metas are controlled by a <em>base</em> meta object which is identified by
an object name <strong>without</strong> a dot in it. For example,
if we have three metas called <code>MetaThing</code>, <code>MetaThing.001</code>,
<code>MetaThing.round</code>, the <em>base</em> meta object would be <code>MetaThing</code>.</p>
<p>The <em>base</em> meta object determines the basis, the resolution, the threshold,
<em>and</em> the transformations. It also has the material and texture area.
In a way, the <em>base</em> meta is the “owner” of the other metas in the family
(i.e. it is as if the other metas were “included” or joined into the base one).</p>
<div>
<p>Hint</p>
<p>When working with multiple scenes,
take care naming your meta objects so the <em>base</em> is always in the same scene as other metas.</p>
<p>Failing to do so will give confusing behaviors (like invisible meta objects).</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Fig. <a href="#fig-meta-ball-base">Meta ball base.</a> shows the <em>base</em> meta labeled “B”.
The other two <em>Meta</em> objects are <em>children</em>. Children’s selection rings are always black,
while the group’s mesh is orange. Because the metas are grouped,
they form a unified mesh which can always be selected by selecting the mesh of any meta in the group.</p>
<figure id="id3">

<p>Meta ball base.</p>

</figure>
<p>For example, in Fig. <a href="#fig-meta-ball-base">Meta ball base.</a>, only the lower sphere (the parent) has been selected,
and you see that both the parent’s mesh <em>and</em> all of the children’s meshes are now highlighted.</p>
<figure id="id4">
<figcaption>
<p>Scaling the “base”.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <em>base</em> meta object controls the <em>polygonalization</em> (mesh structure) for the group, and
as such, also controls the polygonalization for the children (non-base) metas.
If we transform the <em>base</em> meta, the children’s polygonalization changes.
However, if we transform the children, the polygonalization remains unchanged.</p>
<div>
<p>Hint</p>
<p>This discussion of “polygonalization” does <em>not</em> mean that the various meshes do not deform
towards or away from each other (meta objects always influence one another in the usual way,
within a same family).</p>
<p>Rather, it means that the underlying mesh structure changes only when the <em>base</em> object transforms.
For example, if you scale the <em>base</em>, the children’s mesh structure changes.</p>
<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig-meta-ball-scale">Scaling the “base”.</a>, the <em>base</em> has been scaled down,
which has the effect of scaling the mesh structure of each of the children. As you can see,
the children’s mesh resolution has increased, while the <em>base</em> decreased.
The children did <em>not</em> change size!</p>
