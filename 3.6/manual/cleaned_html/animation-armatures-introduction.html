<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>An armature in Blender can be thought of as similar to the armature of a real skeleton,
and just like a real skeleton an armature can consist of many bones.
These bones can be moved around and anything that they are attached to or
associated with will move and deform in a similar way.</p>
<p>An “armature” is a type of object used for rigging.
A rig is the controls and strings that move a marionette (puppet).
Armature object borrows many ideas from real-world skeletons.</p>

<h2>Your First Armature</h2>
<p>In order to see what we are talking about, let us try to add the default armature in Blender.</p>
<p>(Note that armature editing details are explained in
the <a href="bones/editing/index.html">armatures editing section</a>.)</p>
<p>Open a default scene, then:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Delete all objects in the scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the cursor is in the world origin with <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd></kbd>.</p></li>
<li><p>Press <kbd>Numpad1</kbd> to see the world in Front view.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a <em>Single Bone</em> (Add ‣ Armature).</p></li>
<li><p>Press <kbd>NumpadDelete</kbd> to see the armature at maximum zoom.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>The Armature Object</h2>
<p>As you can see, an armature is like any other object type in Blender:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It has an origin, a position, a rotation and a scale factor.</p></li>
<li><p>It has an Object Data data-block, that can be edited in <em>Edit Mode</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be linked to other scenes, and the same armature data can be reused on multiple objects.</p></li>
<li><p>All animation you do in <em>Object Mode</em> is only working on the whole object,
not the armature’s bones (use the <em>Pose Mode</em> to do this).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As armatures are designed to be posed, either for a static or animated scene,
they have a specific state, called “rest position”. This is the armature’s default “shape”,
the default position/rotation/scale of its bones, as set in <em>Edit Mode</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>Edit Mode</em>, you will always see your armature in rest position,
whereas in <em>Object Mode</em> and <em>Pose Mode</em>,
you usually get the current “pose” of the armature
(unless you enable the <em>Rest Position</em> button of the <em>Armature</em> panel).</p>
