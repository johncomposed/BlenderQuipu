<p>In this mode, the pivot point lies at the center of the bounding box, which is a box that’s
wrapped as tightly as possible around the selection while still being aligned to the world axes.</p>
<section id="in-object-mode">
<h2>In Object Mode</h2>
<p>The pivot point becomes the center of the bounding box <em>around the selected objects’
origin points</em>, not their geometry.</p>
<p>This means that, if you have a single object selected, the pivot point is the same
as the object’s <a href="../../../../scene_layout/object/origin.html">origin point</a> – which can be customized
and doesn’t have to be in the center. In the example below, the orange rectangle
has it in a corner instead.</p>

<p>If you have multiple objects selected, the pivot point becomes the center
of an imaginary box around their origins.</p>
<p>The image below shows the difference between Bounding Box Center
and <a href="median_point.html">Median Point</a>.
The latter calculates the average position of the origins,
meaning that the pivot point shifts towards the area with the most objects.</p>
