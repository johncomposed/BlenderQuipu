<h1>Action Constraint</h1>
<p>The <em>Action</em> constraint is powerful.
It allows you control
an <a href="../../../editors/dope_sheet/action.html">Action</a> using the transformations of another object.</p>
<p>The underlying idea of the <em>Action</em> constraint is very similar to the one behind
the <a href="../../drivers/index.html">Drivers</a>, except that the former uses a whole action
(i.e. multiple F-Curves of the same type), while the latter controls a single F-Curve of their “owner”…</p>
<p>Note that even if the constraint accepts the <em>Mesh</em> action type,
only the <em>Object</em>, <em>Pose</em> and <em>Constraint</em> types are really working,
as constraints can only affect objects’ or bones’ transform properties, and not meshes’ shapes.
Also note that only the object transformation (location, rotation, scale) is affected by the action,
if the action contains keyframes for other properties they are ignored, as constraints do not influence those.</p>
<p>As an example, let us assume you have defined an <em>Object</em> action
(it can be assigned to any object, or even no object at all),
and have mapped it on your owner through an <em>Action</em> constraint,
so that moving the target in the (0.0 to 2.0)
range along its X axis maps the action content on the owner in the (0 to 100)
frame range. This will mean that when the target’s <em>X</em> property is 0.0
the owner will be as if in frame 0 of the linked action;
with the target’s <em>X</em> property at 1.0
the owner will be as if in frame 50 of the linked action, etc.</p>

<dt>Evaluation Time</dt><dd><p>This property allows objects to be driven without a constraint target
by interpolating between the <em>Action Start</em> and <em>End</em> frames.
The relative position between the start and end frame can be controlled using the value slider.</p>
<p>This is very helpful for more complex rigging and mechanical rigs, as it means the Action constraint
can be controlled directly with a <a href="../../drivers/index.html">Driver</a>

<dt>Mix</dt><dd><p>Specifies how the keyframed transformation from the action is combined with the existing transformation.

<dl>
<dt>Before/After Original (Full)</dt><dd><p>The keyframed transformation is added before/after the existing transformation, as if it was
applied to an imaginary parent/child of the constraint owner. Scale is handled like in
the most basic <a href="../../armatures/bones/properties/relations.html#bpy-types-editbone-inherit-scale">Full Inherit Scale</a> mode of bones,
so combining non-uniform scale and rotation will create shear.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Before/After Original (Aligned)</dt><dd><p>The keyframed transformation is added before/after the existing transformation, as if it was

the <a href="../../armatures/bones/properties/relations.html#bpy-types-editbone-inherit-scale">Aligned Inherit Scale</a> mode of bones to
avoid creating shear.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to using the <em>Split Channels</em> option, but replacing the location component with
the result of <em>Full</em>. If only uniform scale is used, the result is identical to <em>Full</em>.</p>

<a href="../transform/copy_scale.html">Copy Scale</a> (with Offset)
constraints bundled together in one operation; the result may be slightly different
in case of sheared inputs.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Aligned</em>, in this mode location channels are simply added together, so rotation
and scale components of the input transformations cannot affect the resulting location.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>When the object or bone already has Action constraints, the next constraint using
a newly keyframed action should be added before all others in order to get
the same final combined transformation. This fact is not affected by the Mix mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike usual, you can have a <em>Start</em> value higher than the <em>End</em> one,
or a <em>Min</em> one higher than a <em>Max</em> one: this will reverse the mapping of the action
(i.e. it will be “played” reversed…), unless you have both sets reversed, obviously!</p></li>
<li><p>When using a <em>Constraint</em> action, it is the constraint <em>channel’s names</em>
that are used to determine to which constraints of the owner apply the action.
E.g. if you have a constraint channel named “trackto_empt1”,
its keyed <em>Influence</em> and/or <em>Head/Tail</em> values (the only ones you can key)
will be mapped to the ones of the owner’s constraint named “trackto_empt1”.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, when using a <em>Pose</em> action
(which is obviously only meaningful and working when constraining a bone!),
it is the bone’s name that is used to determine which bone <em>channel’s names</em> from the action to use
(e.g. if the constrained bone is named “arm”, it will use and only use the action’s bone channel named “arm”…).
Unfortunately, using a <em>Pose</em> action on a whole armature object
(to affect all the keyed bones in the action at once) will not work…</p></li>
<li><p>Actions can also be marked as <a href="../../../glossary/index.html#term-Asset">Asset</a>, but with certain limitations.
For more info, see <a href="../../armatures/posing/editing/pose_library.html">Pose Library</a>.</p></li>
