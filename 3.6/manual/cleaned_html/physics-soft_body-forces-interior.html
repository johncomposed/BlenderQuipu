<h1>Interior</h1>
<p>In between each neighboring vertex of a mesh, you typically create edges to connect them.
Imagine each edge as a spring. Any mechanical spring is able to stretch under tension,
and to squeeze under pressure. All springs have an ideal length,
and a stiffness that limits how far you can stretch or squeeze the spring.</p>
<p>In Blender’s case, the ideal length is the original edge length which you designed as a part of your mesh,
even before you enable the Soft Body system. Until you add the Soft Body physics,
all springs are assumed to be perfectly stiff: no stretch and no squeeze.</p>
<p>You can adjust the stiffness of all those edge springs, allowing your mesh to sag, to bend,
to flutter in the breeze, or to puddle up on the ground.</p>
<p>To create a connection between the vertices of a soft body object there have to be forces
that hold the vertices together. These forces are effective along the edges in a mesh,
the connections between the vertices. The forces act like a spring.
Fig. <a href="#fig-softbody-force-interior-connection">Vertices and forces along their connection edges.</a> illustrates how a 3×3 grid of vertices
(a mesh plane in Blender) are connected in a soft body simulation.</p>

<p>But two vertices could freely rotate if you do not create additional edges between them.
The logical method to keep a body from collapsing would be to create additional edges between the vertices.
This works pretty well, but would change your mesh topology drastically.</p>
<p>Luckily, Blender allows to define additional <em>virtual</em> connections.
On one hand you can define virtual connections between the diagonal edges of a quad face
(<em>Stiff Quads</em> Fig. <a href="#fig-softbody-force-interior-stiff">Additional forces with Stiff Quads enabled.</a>),
on the other hand you can define virtual connections between a vertex and any vertices connected
to its neighbors’ <em>Bending Stiffness</em>. In other words, the amount of bend that is allowed between
a vertex and any other vertex that is separated by two edge connections.</p>
<section id="settings">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>The characteristics of edges are set with the <em>Springs</em> and <em>Stiff Quads</em> properties in the <em>Soft Body Edges</em> panel.
See the <a href="../settings/edges.html">Soft Body Edges settings</a> for details.</p>

<h3>Stiff Quads</h3>
<p>To show the effect of the different edge settings we will use two cubes
(blue: only quads, red: only tris) and let them fall without any goal onto a plane
(how to set up collision is shown on the page <a href="../collision.html">Collisions</a>).</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig-softbody-force-interior-without">Without Stiff Quads.</a>, the default settings are used (without <em>Stiff Quads</em>).
The “quad only” cube will collapse completely, the cube composed of tris keeps its shape,
though it will deform temporarily because of the forces created during collision.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig-softbody-force-interior-with">With Stiff Quads.</a>, <em>Stiff Quads</em> is activated (for both cubes).
Both cubes keep their shape, there is no difference for the red cube,
because it has no quads anyway.</p>

<h3>Bending Stiffness</h3>
<p>The second method to stop an object from collapsing is to change its <em>Bending</em> stiffness.
This includes the diagonal edges (damping also applies to these connections).</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig-softbody-force-interior-bending">Bending Stiffness.</a>, <em>Bending</em> is activated with a strength setting of 1.

<p>Bending stiffness can also be used if you want to make a subdivided plane more plank like.
Without <em>Bending</em> the faces can freely rotate against each other like hinges
Fig. <a href="#fig-softbody-force-interior-no-bending">No bending stiffness.</a>.
There would be no change in the simulation if you activated <em>Stiff Quads</em>,
because the faces are not deformed at all in this example.</p>
<p>Bending stiffness is the strength needed for the plane to be deformed.</p>
