<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In <em>Pose Mode</em>, bones behave like objects. So the transform actions
(move, rotate, scale, etc.) are very similar to the same ones in Object Mode
(all available ones are regrouped in the Pose ‣ Transform submenu). However,
there are some important specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bones’ relationships are crucial (see <a href="../../bones/properties/relations.html#bpy-types-editbone-parent">Bone Parenting</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The “transform center” of a given bone
(i.e. its default pivot point, when it is the only selected one) is <em>its root</em>.
Note by the way that some pivot point options seem to not work properly. In fact,
except for the <em>3D Cursor</em> one, all others appear to always use the median point of the selection
(and not e.g. the active bone’s root when <em>Active Object</em> is selected, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Posing</h2>
<p>As previously noted, bones’ transformations are performed based on the <em>Rest Position</em> of
the armature, which is its state as defined in <em>Edit Mode</em>. This means that in
rest position, in <em>Pose Mode</em>, each bone has a scale of 1.0, and null rotation
and position (as you can see it in the <em>Transform</em> panel, in the 3D Viewport’s Sidebar).</p>

<div>
<p>Note that the two green lines materializing the axes are centered on the armature’s center,
and not each bone’s root…</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Moreover, the local space for these actions is the bone’s own one
(visible when you enable the <em>Axes</em> option of the <em>Armature</em> panel).
This is especially important when using axis locking, for example,
there is no specific “bone roll” tool in <em>Pose Mode</em>,
as you can rotate around the bone’s main axis just by locking on the local Y axis
<kbd><kbd>R</kbd> <kbd>Y</kbd> <kbd>Y</kbd></kbd>… This also works with several bones selected;
each one is locked to its own local axis!</p>
<p>When you pose your armature,
you are supposed to have one or more objects skinned on it! And obviously,
when you transform a bone in <em>Pose Mode</em>,
its related objects or object’s shape is moved/deformed accordingly, in real-time.
Unfortunately, if you have a complex rig set-up and/or a heavy skin object,
this might produce lag during interactive editing.
If you experience such troubles, try enabling the <em>Delay Deform</em> button in
the <em>Armature</em> panel the skin objects will only be updated once you confirm
the transform operation.</p>
