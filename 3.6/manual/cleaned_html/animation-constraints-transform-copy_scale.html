<h1>Copy Scale Constraint</h1>
<p>The <em>Copy Scale</em> constraint forces its owner to have the same scale as its target.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Here we talk of <em>scale</em>, not of <em>size</em>! Indeed, you can have two objects,
one much bigger than the other, and yet both of them have the same scale.
This is also true with bones: in <em>Pose Mode</em>,
they all have a unitary scale when they are in rest position,
represented by their visible length.</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Since scale is a multiplicative quantity, it should be combined using multiplication,
and split into fractions or inverted via power. Thus the use of <em>Power</em> is
more mathematically correct than <em>Influence</em>, which uses linear interpolation.
The use of the <em>Additive</em> option is also not recommended.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>To copy scale from one axis of the target to all axes of the owner,
disable other axes, enable <em>Make Uniform</em>, and set <em>Power</em> to 3.</p>
