<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The proverb “A good start is half the battle”, certainly applies to video editing.
Setting up your <em>work environment</em> and <em>project</em> to your needs is key to success.
In setting up your video project, you have to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work Environment related settings and activities:</p>
<p>These settings apply to all of your projects and are set at “Blender level”; for example the installation
of add-ons. In fact, they can also influence your non-video editing projects.
Most of these settings remain more or less stable throughout your projects and should probably only set once.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project related settings and activities:</p>
<p>These settings vary from project to project and are very specific for your project;
for example the output media format. For each new project, you have to evaluate these settings and activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, many settings and activities occur at both levels.
For example, automatic proxies can be enabled globally but changed on a per project or even strip basis.
The layout of the Video Editing Workspace is defined at Blender level but can be tweaked per project.</p>
