<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Metaball objects (short meta) are <em>implicit surfaces</em>,
meaning that they are <em>not explicitly</em> defined by vertices (as meshes are)
or control points (as surfaces are): they exist <em>procedurally</em>.
Meta objects are literally mathematical formulas that are calculated on-the-fly by Blender.</p>
<p>A very distinct visual characteristic of metas is that they are fluid <em>mercurial</em>,
or <em>clay-like</em> forms that have a “rounded” shape. Furthermore,
when two meta objects get close to one another, they begin to interact with one another.
They “blend” or “merge”, as water droplets do, especially in zero-g (which, by the way,
makes them very handy for modeling streams of water when you do not want to do a fluid simulation).
If they subsequently move away from one another, they restore their original shape.</p>
<p>Each of these is defined by its own underlying mathematical <a href="structure.html">structure</a>,
and you can at any time switch between them using the <em>Active Element</em> panel.</p>
<p>Typically <em>Meta</em> objects are used for special effects or as a basis for modeling.
For example, you could use a collection of metas to form the initial shape of your model and
then convert it to a mesh for further modeling or sculpting. Meta objects are also very efficient for ray tracing.</p>

<p>Warning</p>
<p>Names of <em>Meta</em> objects are very important, as they define <a href="editing.html#meta-ball-object-families">families</a>,
and only objects within a same family interact with each other.
Unlike other object types, even edition (transformations) in Object Mode will affect the generated geometry
within the edited families.</p>

<h2>Visualization</h2>
<p>In Object Mode, the calculated mesh is shown, along with a black “selection ring”.</p>

</figure>
<p>In Edit Mode (Fig. <a href="#fig-meta-ball-example">Meta Ball in Edit Mode.</a>), a meta is displayed as a mesh
(either shaded or as black wireframe, but without any vertex of course),
with two colored circles: a red one for selection (pink when selected),
and a green one for a direct control of the meta’s stiffness (light green when active).
Note that except for the <a href="../../scene_layout/object/editing/transform/scale.html#bpy-ops-transform-resize">scale transformation</a>,
having the green circle highlighted is equivalent to having the red one.</p>
