<h2>Technical Terms</h2>
<p>In general, the technical terms used in computer graphics are quite new or even downright
neologisms invented for the needs,
so they do not always have a translation in your language. Moreover,
a large part of Blender users use its English interface.</p>
<p>As a result, unless a term has an evident translation,
you should preferably use the English one, <em>putting it in italic</em>.
You can then find a translation for it, which you will use from times to times (e.g. to avoid repetitions…).
This is also valid in the other way: even when a term has a straightforward translation,
do not hesitate to use its English version from times to times, to get the reader used with it…</p>
<p>If a term is definitively not translatable, simply use the English one,
but make sure its glossary entry is translated.</p>
<p>In the glossary, the English term is written first (to maintain alphabetic order)
with the translated entry following in parenthesis, when appropriate.</p>
</section>
<section id="adding-text">
<h2>Adding Text</h2>
<p>Generally, <strong>you should always translate exactly what is in the text</strong>,
and avoid providing updates or extra information.</p>
<p>But sometimes that is necessary, for example when talking about the manual itself:
To a foreign reader it is not clear, that they can contribute English text only,
whereas this is obvious to an English reader.</p>
<p>In these (rare) cases you can and should provide extra information.</p>
</section>
<section id="keeping-pages-up-to-date">
<h2>Keeping Pages Up To Date</h2>
<p>When the manual is updated, those translations which are outdated will be marked as fuzzy.
To keep track with that, you can use a tool we created for that task,
see <a href="contribute.html#translations-fuzzy-strings">How to install it</a>.</p>
