<p>This brush simulates cloth physics on the mesh under the brush cursor.
There are various deformation types and settings to customize the brush.</p>
<p>It’s also easy to sculpt the mesh with other brushes and tools
in between using the cloth brushes.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Using a relatively small brush size makes the calculations much faster,
while larger brush sizes might be too slow to get a usable brush.</p>
