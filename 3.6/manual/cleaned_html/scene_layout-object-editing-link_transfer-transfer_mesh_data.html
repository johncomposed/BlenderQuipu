<p>The <em>Data Transfer</em> tool transfers several types of data from one mesh to another.
Data types include vertex groups, UV maps, Color Attributes, custom normals…
Transfer works by generating a mapping between source mesh’s elements (vertices, edges, etc.)
and destination ones, either on a one-to-one basis, or mapping several source elements
to a single destination one by interpolated mapping.</p>
<p>Transfers data layer(s) from active to selected meshes.</p>

<h2>Vertex Mapping</h2>
<section id="topology">

<p>The simplest option, expects both meshes to have identical number of elements, and match them by order (indices).
Useful e.g. between meshes that were identical copies, and got deformed differently.</p>

<h2>Further Options</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Auto Transform</dt><dd><p>Automatically computes the transformation to get the best possible match between source and destination meshes.</p>
<p>This allows to match and transfer data between two meshes with similar shape,
but transformed differently. Note that you’ll get best results with exact copies of the same mesh.
Otherwise, you’ll likely get better results
if you “visually” make them match in 3D space (and use <em>Object Transform</em>) instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Object Transform</dt><dd><p>Evaluate source and destination meshes in global space.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Only Neighbor Geometry</dt><dd><p>Source elements must be closer than given distance from destination one.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Max Distance</dt><dd><p>Maximum allowed distance between source and destination element (for non-topology mappings).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Ray Radius</dt><dd><p>The starting ray radius to use when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting">Ray Casting</a>
against vertices or edges. When transferring data between meshes Blender performs a series of
ray casts to generate mappings. Blender starts with a ray with the radius defined here,
if that does not detect a hit then the radius is progressively
increased until a positive hit or a limit is reached.</p>
<p>This property acts as an accuracy/performance control;
using a lower ray radius will be more accurate however,
might take longer if Blender has to progressively increase the limit.
Lower values will work better for dense meshes with lots of detail
while larger values are probably better suited for simple meshes.</p>

<dt>Mix Mode</dt><dd><p>How to affect destination elements with source values.</p>
<dl>
<dt>All</dt><dd><p>Replaces everything in destination (note that <em>Mix Factor</em> is still used).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Above Threshold</dt><dd><p>Only replaces destination value if it is above given threshold <em>Mix Factor</em>.
How that threshold is interpreted depends on data type,
note that for Boolean values this option fakes a logical AND.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Below Threshold</dt><dd><p>Only replaces destination value if it is below given threshold <em>Mix Factor</em>.
How that threshold is interpreted depends on data type,
note that for Boolean values this option fakes a logical OR.</p>

<dt>Mix, Add, Subtract, Multiply</dt><dd><p>Apply that operation, using mix factor to control how much of source or destination value to use.
Only available for a few types (vertex groups, Color Attributes).</p>

<dt>Mix Factor</dt><dd><p>How much of the transferred data gets mixed into existing one (not supported by all data types).</p>
