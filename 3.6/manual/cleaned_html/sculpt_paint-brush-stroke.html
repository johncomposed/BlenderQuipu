<h1>Stroke</h1>
<p>The stroke settings define the behavior of the sculpted/painted stroke.
Any other brush behavior and effect is applied on top of the stroke.</p>

<dt>Stroke Method <kbd>E</kbd></dt><dd><p>Defines the way brush strokes are applied to the canvas.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Dots:</dt>
<dd><p>Apply paint on each mouse move step. This is regardless of their distance to each other,
and instead depends on the stroke speed.
This means that a slower stroke will have more accumulative strength applied.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Drag Dot:</dt>
<dd><p>Leaves only one dab on the canvas which can be placed by dragging.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Space:</dt>
<dd><p>Creates brush stroke as a series of dots,
whose distance (spacing) is determined by the <em>Spacing</em> setting.</p>

<dt>Anchored:</dt>

Clicking and dragging will resize the dab diameter.</p>
<dl id="bpy-types-brush-use-edge-to-edge">
<dt>Edge to Edge</dt><dd><p>The brush location and orientation are determined by a two point circle,
where the first click is one point, and dragging places the second point, opposite from the first.</p>
</dd>

</dd>
<dt>Line:</dt>
<dd><p>Clicking and dragging lets you define a line in screen space.
The line dabs are separated by <em>Spacing</em>, similar to space strokes.
With <kbd>Alt</kbd> the line stroke is constrained to 45 degree increments.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Curve:</dt>
<dd><p>Defines the stroke curve with a Bézier curve (dabs are separated according to <em>Spacing</em>).
This Bézier curve is stored in Blender as a “Paint Curve” data-block.</p>
<p>Use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>RMB</kbd></kbd> to create the initial control point of the curve.</p>

A few transform operators are supported such as moving(<kbd>G</kbd>), rotating(<kbd>R</kbd>) and scaling (<kbd>S</kbd>).</p>
