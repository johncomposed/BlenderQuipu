<h1>Pull Requests</h1>
<p>This page describes the tools used for code contribution and review.</p>
<p>Reviews are a key measure to assure changes are of a good quality.
They help preventing bugs, design consistencies, or potential maintenance problems.
And having your work reviewed also generally keeps you on your toes.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Writers who have been given commit access can commit to the
main repository without needing to fork the repository.</p>
<p>See <a href="guides/commit_guide.html">Commit Guidelines</a> if this applies to you.</p>
</div>
<section id="one-time-setup">
<h2>One Time Setup</h2>
<p>This assumes you have the Blender manual repository already checked out on your computer,
following the <a href="install/index.html">install instructions</a>.</p>
<section id="fork">
<h3>Fork</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to Blender repository and click the Fork button.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm the fork with the default settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you will have to add your personal fork as a remote in your local git repository.
Click <em>SSH</em> to see the correct URL, and then add it like this:</p>
<div><div><pre>git remote add me git@projects.blender.org:&lt;USERNAME&gt;/blender-manual.git
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>In order to push to the fork repository, you need an SSH key.
If you don’t already have the file <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>,
there’s a simple command to generate such keys which works on Linux, macOS, and in Git Bash on Windows:</p>
<div><div><pre>ssh-keygen
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command will generate a private key id_rsa and a public key id_rsa.pub in <code>~/.ssh</code>.
The private key must never be shown or sent to anyone else to avoid compromising your account,
but the public key is safe to share.</p>
<p>The contents of <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> can be copied and pasted into
the <a href="https://projects.blender.org/user/settings/keys">account settings on projects.blender.org</a>,
after clicking “Add Key”. Any name for the SSH key is ok.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>The workflow for working with pull requests can be found on the
<a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Tools/Pull_Requests">Blender Developer’s Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Note, some text in the above guideline is focused on the main Blender repository,
however, the workflow is the same for any Blender project.</p>

<section id="guidelines-for-reviewers">
<h2>Guidelines for Reviewers</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The pull request text should be usable as the git commit message
(see the <a href="guides/commit_guide.html#contribute-commit-good-message">guidelines</a> for details).</p></li>
<li><p>Be explicit when some changes are to be addressed before committing, without the need for a review iteration.</p></li>
<li><p>If the pull request is not approved the author is expected to make another iteration.</p></li>
<li><p>If the change needs agreement on the design task first, put the pull request on hold by adding a
<code>WIP:</code> prefix in the title, indicating the author considers the pull request not ready to be merged.
No review is expected unless the author specifically asks for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Writers are expected to reply to pull requests in 3 working days.</p></li>
<li><p>Add relevant modules/projects to tags.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign individuals (instead of modules/projects) for reviewers, to avoid too much noise.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage new writes to do review, it’s a good way to learn and important to grow the project.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="tips">
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To get the patch file, add .patch to the end of the URL of the pull request.
Example:</p>
<div><div><pre>https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender-manual/pulls/104892.patch
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Checkout a pull request into a detached head (not leaving behind a branch).
Example:</p>
<div><div><pre>git fetch -q origin +refs/pull/104892/head: ; git checkout -qf FETCH_HEAD
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
