<h1>Installing on Windows</h1>
<p>Check the <a href="index.html">Downloading Blender</a>
page to find the minimum requirements and the different versions that are available
for Blender (if you have not done so yet).</p>
<p>Download the zip-file or Windows Installer File.</p>
<section id="install-from-windows-installer-file">
<h2>Install from Windows Installer File</h2>
<p>The Windows installer will let you choose an installation folder,
and will create an entry in the start menu as well as associate blend-files with Blender.
It requires administrator rights.</p>
</section>
<section id="install-from-zip">
<h2>Install from Zip</h2>
<p>When choosing the zip-file, you have to manually extract Blender to the desired folder,
where you can double-click the executable to run Blender.</p>
<p>No start menu item will be created and no blend-file association will be registered,
but there is also no need for administrator rights. You can register the file association
manually by clicking <em>Make Default</em> on the System tab of the
<a href="../../editors/preferences/system.html">Preferences</a>. Alternatively, you can run <code>blender -r</code>
from the <a href="../../advanced/command_line/arguments.html">Command Line</a>.</p>

<p>Tip</p>
<p>How to Make a Portable Installation</p>
<p>To keep all configuration files and installed add-ons in the executable folder,
create a folder named <code>config</code> in the <a href="../../advanced/blender_directory_layout.html#blender-directory-layout">LOCAL directory</a>
of the unzipped folder.</p>

<h2>Install from Microsoft Store</h2>
<p>Blender can be installed from the Microsoft Store by searching for Blender in the Microsoft Store
and installing it.</p>
<p>Blender can now be launched from the Windows Start menu.</p>

<h2>Updating on Windows</h2>
<p>On Windows there are various ways of updating Blender. This section covers the most common approaches.</p>
<section id="updating-from-windows-installer-file">
<h3>Updating from Windows Installer File</h3>
<p>When an update for Blender is released, it can be downloaded directly
from the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/">Blender website</a>.
The Windows installer can then be run to install the updated version of Blender.
To remove a previously installed version of Blender,
use Windows settings or control panel to uninstall the desired version.</p>

<section id="updating-from-zip">
<h3>Updating from Zip</h3>
<p>When an update for Blender is released, it can be downloaded directly
from the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/">Blender website</a>
and extracted to the desired folder, where you can double-click the executable to run Blender.
For more information on creating a portable version of Blender, see the section <a href="#install-from-zip">Install from Zip</a>.</p>
<p>Note, you do not have to overwrite your existing Blender installation.
Itâ€™s perfectly possible to have multiple versions installed side by side.</p>
