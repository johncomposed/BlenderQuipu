<dt>Taper Object</dt><dd><p>Tapering a curve causes it to get thinner towards one end.
You can also alter the proportions of the Taper throughout the tapered object
by moving/scaling/rotating the control points of the Taper Object.
The taper curve is evaluated along the local X axis, using the local Y axis for width control.
In order for this to work the Taper Object can only be another <em>open curve</em>.</p>
<p>The details are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The taper is applied independently to all curves of the extruded object.</p></li>
<li><p>Only the first curve in a <em>Taper Object</em> is evaluated, even if you have several separated segments.</p></li>
<li><p>The scaling starts at the first control point on the left
and moves along the curve to the last control point on the right.</p></li>
<li><p>Negative scaling, (e.g. negative local Y on the taper curve) is possible as well.
However, rendering artifacts may appear.</p></li>
<li><p>You may need to increase the curve resolution to see more detail of the taper.</p></li>
<li><p>The Taper Object is distributed by control points.
Therefor unevenly spaced control points may likelier to stretch the shape of the taper.
Subdividing segments causes those points to use a larger fraction of the overall taper shape.</p></li>
<li><p>With closed curves, the taper curve in <em>Taper Object</em> acts along the whole curve (perimeter of the object),
not just the length of the object, and varies the extrusion depth. In these cases,
you want the relative height of the <em>Taper Object</em>
Taper curve at both ends to be the same, so that the cyclic point
(the place where the endpoint of the curve connects to the beginning) is a smooth transition.</p></li>

<p>Editing the handles and control points of the Taper Object
will instantly change the shape of the original object.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This <a href="../../../interface/controls/templates/curve.html#ui-curve-widget">Curve Widget</a> allows the creation of a user-defined profile with more complexity than
with the single profile parameter. The modal tool allows toggling the custom profile,
but the shape of the profile is only editable in the options panel after the operation is confirmed.</p>
<p>The profile starts at the bottom right of the widget and ends at the top left, as if it
were between two edges intersecting at a right angle. Control points are created in the widget and
then the path is sampled with the number of segments from the Bevel modifier.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The <em>Profile</em> curve widget stays active when miters are enabled
because it still controls the shape of the miter profiles.</p>

<dt>Presets</dt><dd><p>The <em>Support Loops</em> and <em>Steps</em> presets are built dynamically depending on

</dd>
<dt>Sampling</dt><dd><p>Samples will first be added to each control point, then if there are enough samples,
they will be divided evenly between the edges. The <em>Sample Straight Edges</em> option toggles whether
the samples are added to edges with sharp control points on either side. If there aren’t enough samples
to give each edge the same number of samples, they will just be added to the most curved edges.
So it is recommended to use at least as many segments as there are control points.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<section id="open-2d-curve">
<h3>Open 2D Curve</h3>
<p>The extrusion will create a “wall” or “ribbon” following the curve shape. If using a <em>Bevel Depth</em>,
the wall becomes a sort of slide or gutter.
If your normals are facing the wrong way you can switch their direction as shown
<a href="../editing/segments.html#curve-switch-direction">here</a>.</p>

</figure>
</section>
<section id="closed-2d-curve">
<h3>Closed 2D Curve</h3>
<p>This is probably the most useful situation, as it will quickly create a volume, with (by default)
two flat and parallel surfaces filling the two sides of the extruded “wall”. You can remove one or both of these
faces by choosing the fill mode: both, front, back, or none.</p>
<p>The optional bevel depth will always create a 90 degree bevels here.</p>

</section>
<section id="d-curve">
<h3>3D Curve</h3>
<p>Here the fact that the curve is closed or not has no importance –
you will never get a volume with an extruded 3D curve, only a wall or ribbon, like with open 2D curves.</p>
<p>However, there is one more feature with 3D curves: the <em>Tilt</em> of the control points (see above).
It will make the ribbon twist around the curve to create a Möbius strip, for example.</p>

<section id="taper">
<h3>Taper</h3>
<p>Let us taper a simple curve circle extruded object using a taper curve. Add a curve,
then exit <em>Edit Mode</em>. Add another one (a closed one, like a circle); call it “BevelCurve”,
and enter its name in the <em>Bevel Object</em> field of the first curve
(<em>Curve</em> tab). We now have a pipe.
Add a third curve while in <em>Object Mode</em> and call it “TaperCurve”.
Adjust the left control point by raising it up about 5 units.</p>
<p>Now return to the Object tab,
and edit the first curve’s <em>Taper Object</em> field in the Geometry panel to reference the new taper curve
which we called “TaperCurve”.
When you hit enter the taper curve is applied immediately,
with the results shown in Fig. <a href="#fig-curves-extrude-taper-curve">Circle curve set as Bevel Object.</a>.</p>

</table>
<p>You can see the <em>taper curve</em> being applied to the <em>extruded object</em>.
Notice how the pipe’s volume shrinks to nothing as the taper curve goes from left to right.
If the taper curve went below the local Y axis the pipe’s inside would become the outside,
which would lead to rendering artifacts.
Of course as an artist that may be what you are looking for!</p>
