<p>Blender provides a set of helper tools for Weight Painting.</p>
<p id="sculpt-paint-weight-paint-editing-subset">The Subset Option</p>
<p>Some of the tools also provide a Subset filter to restrict their functionality to only specific vertex groups
(in the <a href="../../interface/undo_redo.html#bpy-ops-screen-redo-last">Adjust Last Operation</a> panel, displayed after the tool is called)
with following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Active Group</p></li>
<li><p>Selected Pose Bones</p></li>
<li><p>Deform Pose Bones</p></li>
<li><p>All Groups</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All tools also work with Vertex Selection Masking and Face Selection Masking.
In these modes the tools operate only on selected vertices or faces.</p>

<section id="mirror">
<h2>Mirror</h2>
<p>The <em>Mirror Vertex Group</em> tool mirrors the weights
from one side of a perfectly symmetrical mesh to the opposite side.
Those vertices that have no corresponding vertex on the other side will not be affected.
But note, the weights are not transferred to the corresponding opposite bone weight group.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Mirroring only works when the object’s rest pose is perfectly symmetrical across the X axis.</p>
</div>

<dl>
<dt>Mirror Weights</dt><dd><p>With this option checked, every selected vertex receives
the weight information of its symmetrical counterpart.
If both vertices are selected, it will be a weight information exchange;
if only one is selected, information from the unselected will overwrite the selected one.
Information on weight is passed for the active group only,
unless <em>All Groups</em> is checked, in which case it is passed for all groups.</p>

however, its weight will be preserved.
If <em>All Groups</em> is checked, all assignations to these kind of groups
will be replaced by the symmetrical counterpart, also keeping the old weights.</p>

<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Mirror to Opposite Bone</p>
<p>If you want to create a mirrored weight group for the opposite bone
(of a symmetric character), then you can do this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Delete the target vertex group (where the mirrored weights will be placed).</p></li>
<li><p>Create a copy of the source bone vertex group
(the group containing the weights which you want to copy).</p></li>
<li><p>Rename the new vertex group to the name of the target vertex group
(the group you deleted above).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the target vertex group and call the Mirror tool
(use only the Mirror weights option and optionally <em>Topology Mirror</em> if your mesh is not symmetric).</p></li>

<h2>Clean</h2>
<p>Clean Vertex Group Weights unassigns vertices from
<a href="../../modeling/meshes/properties/vertex_groups/index.html">Vertex Groups</a>
whose weights are below the <em>Limit</em>. Removes weights below a given threshold.
This tool is useful for clearing your weight groups of very low (or zero) weights.</p>
<p>In the example shown, a cutoff value of 0.2 is used (see operator options below)
so all blue parts are cleaned out.</p>
<p>Note, the images use the <em>Show Zero weights</em> Active option
so that unreferenced Weights are shown in Black.</p>

<h2>Quantize</h2>
<p>This operator uses a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization">Quantization</a>

so there is no longer a smooth gradient between values.</p>

(0.0 - 1.0). So you will never get negative weights or overheated areas
(weight &gt; 1.0) with this tool.</p>

</section>
<section id="smooth">
<h2>Smooth</h2>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>The Smooth tool only works when “Vertex selection masking for painting” is enabled.
Otherwise the tool button is grayed out.</p>
</div>
<p>Blends the weights of selected vertices with adjacent unselected vertices.
This tool only works in vertex select mode.</p>
<p>To understand what the tool really does, let us take a look at a simple example.
The selected vertex is connected to four adjacent vertices
(marked with a gray circle in the image). All adjacent vertices are unselected.
Now the tool calculates the average weight of all connected <strong>and</strong> unselected vertices.
In the example this is:</p>
<p>\((1 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 4 = 0.25\)</p>
<p>This value is multiplied by the factor given in the Operator options (see below).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the factor is 0.0 then actually nothing happens at all and the vertex just keeps its value.</p></li>
<li><p>If the factor is 1.0 then the calculated average weight is taken (0.25 here).</p></li>
<li><p>Dragging the factor from 0 to 1 gradually changes from the old value to the calculated average.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us see what happens when we select all
but one of the neighbors of the selected vertex as well.
Again all connected and unselected vertices are marked with a gray circle.
When we call the Smooth tool now and set the Factor to 1.0,
then we see different results for each of the selected vertices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The top-most and bottom-most selected vertices:</p>
<p>are surrounded by three unselected vertices, with an average weight of \((1 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.333\)
So their color has changed to light green.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The middle vertex:</p>
<p>is connected to one unselected vertex with <code>weight = 1</code>.
So the average weight is 1.0 in this case, thus the selected vertex has changed to red.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The right vertex:</p>
<p>is surrounded by three unselected vertices with average weight = \((0 + 0 + 0) / 3 = 0.0\)
So the average weight is 0, thus the selected vertex has not changed at all
(it was already blue before Smooth was applied).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally let us look at a practical example.
The middle edge loop has been selected
and it will be used for blending the left side to the right side of the area.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All selected vertices have two unselected adjacent vertices.</p></li>
<li><p>The average weight of the unselected vertices is \((1 + 0) / 2 = 0.5\)</p></li>
<li><p>Thus when the <em>Factor</em> is set to 1.0 then the edge loop turns to
green and finally does blend the cold side (right) to the hot side (left).</p></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Factor</dt><dd><p>The effective amount of blending.
When Factor is set to 0.0 then the <a href="#smooth">Smooth</a> tool does not do anything.
For Factor &gt; 0 the weights of the affected vertices gradually shift from their original value
towards the average weight of all connected <strong>and</strong> unselected vertices (see examples above).</p>

<section id="transfer-weights">
<h2>Transfer Weights</h2>
<p>Copy weights from other objects to the vertex groups of the active object.</p>
<p>By default this tool copies only the active (selected) vertex group of the source object
to the active vertex group of target object or creates a new one if the group does not exist.
However, you can change the tool’s behavior in the <a href="../../interface/undo_redo.html#bpy-ops-screen-redo-last">Adjust Last Operation</a> panel.</p>
<p>For example, to transfer all existing vertex groups from the source objects to the target,
change the <em>Source Layers Selection</em> option to <em>By Name</em>.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>This tool uses the generic “data transfer”, but transfers from all selected objects to active one.
Please refer to the <a href="../../scene_layout/object/editing/link_transfer/transfer_mesh_data.html">Data Transfer</a>
docs for options details and explanations.</p>
</div>
<section id="prepare-the-copy">
<h3>Prepare the Copy</h3>
<p>You first select all source objects, and finally the target object
(the target object must be the active object).</p>
<p>It is important that the source objects and the target object are at the same location.
If they are placed side-by-side, then the weight transfer will not work. (See the <em>Vertex Mapping</em> option.)
You can place the objects on different layers,
but you have to ensure that all objects are visible when you call the tool.</p>
<p>Now ensure that the target object is in Weight Paint Mode.
Open the Toolbar and call the <em>Transfer Weights</em> tool in the <em>Weight Tools</em> panel.</p>
</section>
<section id="adjust-last-operation-panel-confusion">
<h3>Adjust Last Operation Panel Confusion</h3>
<p>You may notice that the <a href="../../interface/undo_redo.html#bpy-ops-screen-redo-last">Adjust Last Operation</a> panel stays available
after the weight transfer is done. The panel only disappears
when you call another Operator that has its own <a href="../../interface/undo_redo.html#bpy-ops-screen-redo-last">Adjust Last Operation</a> panel.
This can lead to confusion when you use Transfer weights repeatedly after you changed your vertex groups.
If you then use the still-visible <a href="../../interface/undo_redo.html#bpy-ops-screen-redo-last">Adjust Last Operation</a> panel,
then Blender will reset your work to its state right before you initially called the <em>Transfer Weights</em> tool.</p>
<p>So when you want to call the <em>Transfer Weights</em> tool again after you made some changes to your
vertex groups, then <strong>always</strong> use the <em>Transfer Weights</em> button,
even if the <a href="../../interface/undo_redo.html#bpy-ops-screen-redo-last">Adjust Last Operation</a> panel is still available.
Unless you really want to reset your changes to the initial call of the tool.</p>
