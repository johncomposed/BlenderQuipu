<h1>Proxies</h1>
<p>Proxies were the historical way in Blender to allow some local editing of linked data-blocks.
This was mostly aimed at character animation.</p>
<p>They are now fully deprecated as of Blender 3.0, replaced by the new
<a href="library_overrides.html">Library Overrides</a>.</p>
<p>Existing proxies in older blend-files will be converted to library overrides when
opening it in Blender 3.2 and later.</p>
