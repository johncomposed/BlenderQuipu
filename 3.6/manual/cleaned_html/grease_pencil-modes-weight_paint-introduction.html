<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Assigning weight to the points is primarily used for rigging strokes in cut-out animation,
where the vertex groups are used to define the relative bone influences on the strokes.
See <a href="../../../sculpt_paint/weight_paint/usage.html">Using Vertex Group</a> for more information.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>A vertex in Grease Pencil is called point. Point and vertex names are equivalent.</p>
</div>
<p>Weight Painting is a method to maintain large amounts of weight information in an intuitive way.
The selected Grease Pencil object is displayed slightly shaded with a rainbow color spectrum.
The color visualizes the weights associated to each point in the active vertex group.
By default blue means unweighted and red means fully weighted.</p>
<p>You assign weights to the points of the object by painting on it with weight brushes.
Starting to paint on a strokes automatically adds weights to the active vertex group
(a new vertex group is created if needed).</p>
