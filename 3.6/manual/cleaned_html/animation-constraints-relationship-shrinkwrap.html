<h1>Shrinkwrap Constraint</h1>
<p>The <em>Shrinkwrap</em> constraint is the “object counterpart” of
the <a href="../../../modeling/modifiers/deform/shrinkwrap.html">Shrinkwrap Modifier</a>.
It moves the owner origin and therefore the owner object’s location to the surface of its target.</p>
<p>This implies that the target <em>must</em> have a surface. In fact,
the constraint is even more selective, as it can only use meshes as targets. Hence,
the <em>Shrinkwrap</em> option is only shown in the <em>Add Constraint to Active Object</em> menu,
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd></kbd>, (or its bone’s equivalent),
when the selected inactive object is a mesh.</p>

<h3>Mode</h3>
<p>This selector allows you to select which method to use to compute the point on
the target’s surface to which to move the owner’s origin. You have these options:</p>
<section id="nearest-surface-point">
<h4>Nearest Surface Point</h4>
<p>The chosen target’s surface’s point will be the nearest one to the original owner’s location.
This is the default and most commonly useful option.</p>
</section>
<section id="projection">
<h4>Projection</h4>
<p>The target’s surface point is determined by projecting the owner’s origin along a given axis.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Project Axis</dt><dd><p>This axis is controlled by the radio buttons that show up when you select this type.
This mean the projection axis can only be aligned with one of the three axes, or their opposites.
When the projection of the owner’s origin along the selected direction does not hit the target’s surface,
the owner’s location is left unchanged.</p>
<p>+X, +Y, +Z, -X, -Y, -Z</p>
</dd>
<dt>Space</dt><dd><p>Coordinate space in which the axis direction is specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Distance</dt><dd><p>Distance cutoff after which projection is assumed to have failed, leaving the location unchanged.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Project Opposite</dt><dd><p>In addition to the selected projection axis, project in the opposite direction and
choose the closest hit.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Face Cull</dt><dd><p>This radio button allows you to prevent any projection over the “front side”
(respectively the “back side”) of the target’s faces. The “side” of a face is determined
by its normal (front being the side “from where” the normal “originates”).</p>
<p>Off, Front, Back</p>
<dl>
<dt>Invert Cull</dt><dd><p>When used with <em>Project Opposite</em> and <em>Face Culling</em>, it inverts the <em>Front</em> or <em>Back</em> cull choice
for the opposite direction.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="nearest-vertex">
<h4>Nearest Vertex</h4>
<p>This method is very similar to the <em>Nearest Surface Point</em> one,
except that the owner’s possible shrink locations are limited to the target’s vertices.</p>
<p>This method doesn’t support the <em>Snap Mode</em> setting described below.</p>
</section>
<section id="target-normal-projection">
<h4>Target Normal Projection</h4>
<p>This method is similar to <em>Nearest Surface Point</em>, but produces a much smoother
projection in return for being significantly slower.</p>
<p>Instead of finding the closest point, it searches for the nearest point
that has its interpolated smooth normal pointing towards or away from the original owner position.
Non-manifold boundary edges are specially handled as infinitely thin cylinders
that emit normals in all perpendicular directions. Ignores flat shading and auto smooth settings.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="snap-mode">
<h3>Snap Mode</h3>
<p>Most Shrinkwrap types support an additional setting to control how the owner is moved to
the target point selected by the methods described above. Some of the choices
only differ if <em>Distance</em> is not zero.</p>
<dl>
<dt>On Surface</dt><dd><p>The owner location is always changed. The offset is applied along the projection line
connecting the original owner location and selected target point towards
the original position.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Outside Surface</dt><dd><p>Like <em>On Surface</em>, but the offset is always applied towards the outside of the target.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Above Surface</dt><dd><p>Like <em>On Surface</em>, but the offset is applied along the smooth normal of the target.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inside</dt><dd><p>The owner is not moved if it is already inside the target.
Offset shrinks the allowed volume towards the inside along the projection line.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Outside</dt><dd><p>The owner is not moved if it is already outside the target.
Offset expands the exclusion volume towards the outside along the projection line.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <em>Inside</em> and <em>Outside</em> options can be used for very crude collision detection.
The inside vs outside determination is done based on the target normal and
is not always stable near 90 degree and sharper angles in the target mesh.</p>
</section>
<section id="align-to-normal">
<h3>Align To Normal</h3>
<p>Whenever <em>Snap Mode</em> is available, it is also possible to align the specified
local axis of the object to the smooth normal of the target at the selected
point. The axis is selected via radio buttons.</p>
<p>The alignment is performed via smallest rotation, like in
<a href="../tracking/damped_track.html">Damped Track</a> constraint.</p>
