<h1>Decimate Modifier</h1>
<p>The <em>Decimate</em> modifier allows you to reduce the vertex/face count of a mesh with minimal shape changes.</p>
<p>This is not usually used on meshes which have been created by modeling carefully and economically
(where all vertices and faces are necessary to correctly define the shape).
But if the mesh is the result of complex modeling,
sculpting and/or applied <a href="subdivision_surface.html">Subdivision Surface</a>/
<a href="multiresolution.html">Multiresolution</a> modifiers,
the <em>Decimate</em> one can be used to reduce the polygon count for a performance increase,
or simply remove unnecessary vertices and edges.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of existing modifiers, this one does not allow
you to visualize your changes in Edit Mode.</p>
<p>The modifier displays the number of remaining faces as a result of the <em>Decimate</em> modifier.</p>

</ul>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Although the <em>Ratio</em> is directly proportional to the number of remaining faces,
triangles are used when calculating the ratio.</p>
<p>This means that if your mesh contains quads or other polygons,
the number of remaining faces will be larger than expected,
because those will remain unchanged if their edges are not collapsed.</p>
<p>This is only true if the <em>Triangulate</em> option is disabled.</p>

<p>It can be thought of as the reverse of subdivide.
It attempts to remove edges that were the result of a subdivide operation.
It is intended for meshes with a mainly grid-based topology (without giving uneven geometry).
If additional editing has been done after the subdivide operation, the results may be unexpected.</p>

Two iterations is the same as one subdivide operation, so you will usually want to use even numbers.</p>
