<h2>Animation</h2>
<p>Animation is making an object move or change shape over time.
Objects can be animated in many ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Moving as a whole object</dt><dd><p>Changing their position, orientation or size in time;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Deforming them</dt><dd><p>Animating their vertices or control points;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inherited animation</dt><dd><p>Causing the object to move based on the movement of another object (e.g. its parent, hook, armature, etc.).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the first two,
but the basics given here are actually vital for understanding the following chapters as well.</p>
<p>Animation is typically achieved with the use of <a href="keyframes/introduction.html">keyframes</a>.</p>

<h2>Rigging</h2>
<p>Rigging is a general term used for adding controls to objects,
typically for the purpose of animation.</p>
<p>Rigging often involves using one or more of the following features:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="armatures/index.html#armatures-index">Armatures</a></dt><dd><p>This allows mesh objects to have flexible joints and is often used for skeletal animation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="constraints/index.html#constraints-index">Constraints</a></dt><dd><p>To control the kinds of motions that make sense and add functionality to the rig.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="../modeling/modifiers/index.html#modifiers-index">Object Modifiers</a></dt><dd><p>Mesh deformation can be quite involved, there are multiple modifiers that help control this.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="shape_keys/index.html#animation-shape-keys-index">Shape Keys</a></dt><dd><p>To support different target shapes <em>(such as facial expressions)</em> to be controlled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="drivers/index.html#animation-drivers-index">Drivers</a></dt><dd><p>So your rig can control many different values at once,
as well as making some properties automatically update based on changes elsewhere.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rigging can be as advanced as your project requires,
rigs are effectively defining own user interface for the animator to use,
without having to be concerned the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<section id="examples">
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>An armature is often used with a modifier to deform a mesh for character animation.</p></li>
<li><p>A camera rig can be used instead of animating the camera object directly to simulate real-world camera rigs
(with a boom arm, mounted on a rotating pedestal for example, effects such as camera jitter can be added too).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The content of this chapter is simply a reference to how rigging is accomplished in Blender.
It should be paired with additional resources such as Nathan Vegdahl’s excellent introduction to
the fundamental concepts of character rigging,
