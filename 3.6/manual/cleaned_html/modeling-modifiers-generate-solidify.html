<dt>Simple</dt><dd><p>This is the default solidify algorithm, which simply extrudes the geometry.
This algorithm does not work on geometry where edges have more than two adjacent faces.</p>
<div>
<p>Important</p>
<p>If the normals of adjacent faces don’t point into the same general direction, simple mode
will not be able to solidify the boundary between those. This happens if the normals
are not recalculated or for example on one-sided surfaces like a Möbius strip.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Complex</dt><dd><p>This is a solidify algorithm which can handle every geometric situation
to guarantee a manifold output geometry. This algorithm is able to
solidify shapes like Möbius strips, Klein bottles, architectural wall layouts
and many more which the <em>Simple Mode</em> isn’t able to do.
If the special cases are not present it is recommended to choose <em>Simple</em>
because the extra logic makes this algorithm much slower.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>There are no options for crease in the Modifier tab because crease is handled in a dynamic way.
The modifier will transfer the creases of the original mesh in a smart way to the output mesh to
work with the <a href="subdivision_surface.html">Subdivision Surface</a> modifier.</p>

<p>Important</p>
<p>The modifier thickness is calculated using local vertex coordinates.
If the object has a non-uniform scale, the thickness will vary on different sides of the object.</p>
<p>To fix this, either <a href="../../../scene_layout/object/editing/apply.html#bpy-ops-object-transform-apply">Apply</a>
or <a href="../../../scene_layout/object/editing/clear.html#bpy-ops-object-clear">Clear</a> the scale.</p>

The inside and outside is determined by the face normals.

<p>Note</p>
<p><em>Fill</em> and <em>Only Rim</em> only make a difference on <a href="../../../glossary/index.html#term-Non-manifold">Non-manifold</a> objects,

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
<section id="even-thickness">
<h3>Even Thickness</h3>
<p>Solidify thickness is an approximation.
While <em>Even Thickness</em> and <em>High Quality Normals</em> should yield good results,
the final wall thickness is not guaranteed and may vary depending on the mesh topology.
Especially for vertices with more than three adjacent faces.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a precise wall thickness in every case, we would need to add/remove faces on
the offset shell, something this modifier does not do since this would add a lot of complexity.
The best option to preserve wall thickness is complex mode with constraints thickness mode,
but it is also not guaranteed to work perfect in every case.</p>
