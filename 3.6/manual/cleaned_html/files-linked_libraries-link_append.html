<h1>Link &amp; Append</h1>
<p>These functions help you reuse materials, objects and other <a href="../data_blocks.html">data-blocks</a>
loaded from another blend-file.
You can build libraries of common content and share them across multiple referencing files.</p>
<p>Newly added collections types are available in Add ‣ Collection Instance in the 3D Viewport.</p>
<p>Look in the <em>Outliner</em>, with display mode set to <em>Blender File</em>, to see all your linked and appended data-blocks.</p>

<p><em>Link</em> creates a reference to the data in the source file such that
changes made there will be reflected in the referencing file the next time it is reloaded.
But linked data is not editable (to some extent, see <a href="library_proxies.html">Proxies</a>).</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../editors/file_browser.html">File Browser</a>,
navigate to the external source blend-file and select the data-block you want to reuse.</p>
<p>When you link an object, it will be placed in your scene at the 3D cursor position.
Many other data types, cameras, curves, and materials for example,
must be linked to an object before they become visible.</p>

<p><em>Append</em> makes a full copy of the data into your blend-file, without keeping any reference to the original one.
You can make further edits to your local copy of the data,
but changes in the external source file will not be reflected in the referencing file.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../editors/file_browser.html">File Browser</a>,
navigate to the external source blend-file and select the data-block you want to reuse.</p>

<p>Blend-files can also be linked/appended by dragging and dropping blend-files into the Blender window.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Appending data you already have linked will add objects/collections to the scene,
but will keep them linked (and un-editable).</p>
<p>This is done so existing relationships with linked data remain intact.</p>

<section id="library-reload-relocate">
<h2>Library Reload &amp; Relocate</h2>
<p>Reloading is useful if you changed something in the library blend-file and want to see those changes
in your current blend-file without having to re-open it.
You can reload and relocate a whole library
from the context menu of the library items in the <em>Outliner</em>’s <em>Blender File</em> view,</p>
<p>Relocating allows you to reload the library from a new file path.
This can be used to either fix a broken linked library
(e.g. because the library file was moved or renamed after linking from it),
or to switch between different variations of a same set of data, in different library files.</p>
<section id="broken-library">
<h3>Broken Library</h3>
<p>While loading a blend-file, if Blender cannot find a library,
it will create placeholder data-blocks to replace missing linked ones.
That way, references to the missing data is not lost, and by relocating the missing library,
the lost data can be automatically restored.</p>

<section id="known-limitations">
<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
<p>For the most part linking data will work as expected, however,
there are some corner cases which are not supported.</p>
<section id="circular-dependencies">
<h3>Circular Dependencies</h3>
<p>In general, dependencies should not go in both directions.
Attempting to link or append data which links back to the current file will likely result in missing links.</p>
</section>
<section id="object-rigid-body-constraints">
<h3>Object Rigid Body Constraints</h3>
<p>When linking objects <em>directly</em> into a blend-file, the <em>Rigid Body</em> settings
<strong>will not</strong> be linked in since they are associated with their scene’s world.
As an alternative, you can link in the entire scene and set it as a
<a href="../../scene_layout/scene/properties.html#bpy-types-scene-background-set">Background Set</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="compression-memory-use">
<h3>Compression &amp; Memory Use</h3>
<p>Linking to blend-files with compression enabled may significantly increase memory usage while loading files.</p>
<p>Reading data on demand isn’t supported with compression
<em>(this only impacts load time, once loaded there is no difference in memory use)</em>.</p>
