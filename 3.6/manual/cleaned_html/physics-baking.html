<h1>Baking Physics Simulations</h1>
<p><a href="../glossary/index.html#term-Baking">Baking</a> refers to the act of storing or caching the results of a calculation.
The result of a simulation is automatically cached to memory when the animation is played,
so that the next time it runs, it can be replayed more quickly by reading the results from the memory.</p>
<p>If you bake the simulation the cache is protected,
and you will be unable to change the simulation settings
until you clear the baked frames by clicking <em>Free Bake</em>.</p>
<p>It is generally recommended to bake your physics simulations before rendering.
Aside from no longer needing to go through the time-consuming process of simulating again,
baking can help prevent potential glitches and ensure that the outcome of the simulation
remains exactly the same every time.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most physics simulators in Blender use a similar system,
but not all have exactly the same settings available. All the settings are covered here,
but individual physics types may not provide all these options.</p>
</div>

<dl>
<dt>Caches List</dt><dd><p>Blender allows for storing and managing multiple caches at once for the same physics object.
You can manage the caches with this <a href="../interface/controls/templates/list_view.html#ui-list-view">list view</a>.
Double-click the cache entry to give it a name.</p>
<p>Each cache can have a name. Double-click the cache entry to give it a name.
If this name is given, any disk cache will be stored in files starting with that name.
For example, a cache named <code>MyCache</code> will be stored in <code>MyCache_xxxxxx_yy.bphys</code>.</p>
<p>If the cache does not have a name (which is the default),
the filename of the cache will depend on the object it is attached to,
although this is not immediately obvious. For example, a cache on
an object <code>Cube</code> will be stored in <code>43756265_xxxxxx_yy.bphys</code>,
where <code>43756265</code> is determined by the object name.</p>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>When there are multiple caches on one object, <strong>always specify a Cache Name</strong>. As described above,
the filename of an unnamed cache is determined by the name of the object it is attached to.
As a result, an object with multiple physics systems that all have an unnamed cache will cause
conflict and <strong>can result in losing cache files</strong>.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>External</dt><dd><p>Allows you to read the cache from a drive using a user-specified file path.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The cache name in <em>Caches List</em> and the <em>Index</em>
has to exactly match the external cache files name in order to work.
The cache files name format is <code>name_frame_index.bphys</code>.</p>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>Index</dt><dd><p>The index number of cache files. (The last two digits of the files name.)</p>

<dt>Path</dt><dd><p>Select the directory path to the cache files.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Disk Cache</dt><dd><p>The cache of a baked simulation will be stored inside the blend-file when you save it.
When <em>Disk Cache</em> is checked, Blender will save the cache separately to
the drive in a folder named <code>blendcache_[filename]</code> alongside the blend-file.
(The blend-file must be saved first.)</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>When using <a href="../files/linked_libraries/library_overrides.html">Library Overrides</a>,
data-blocks only support <em>Disk Cache</em> storage.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Use Library Path</dt><dd><p>Share the disk cache when the physics object is
<a href="../files/linked_libraries/index.html">linked</a> into another blend-file.
When this option is enabled, linked versions of the object will reference the same disk cache.
Otherwise linked versions of the object will use independent caches.</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The simulation is only calculated for positive frames
in between the <em>Start</em> and <em>End</em> frames of the <em>Cache</em> panel, whether you bake or not.
So if you want a simulation that is longer than the default frame range you have to change the <em>End</em> frame.</p>

<dt>Cache Step</dt><dd><p>Interval for storing simulation data.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Some physics systems (such as particles)
allow for positions to be stored only on every nth frame,
letting the positions for in-between frames be interpolated.
Using a cache step greater than one will result in a smaller cache,
but the result may differ from the original simulation.</p>
