<h1>Header</h1>
<p>Every constraint has a header.
The interface elements of the header are explained below using a Copy Location constraint as an example.</p>

<dt>Name</dt><dd><p>Give the constraint a meaningful name in this text field, which describes its purpose.
Meaningful names help you and your team members understand what each constraint is supposed to do.</p>
<p>The <em>red</em> background is a warning that the constraint is not yet functional.
The background will turn <em>gray</em> when the constraint is functioning.
When this Copy Location constraint has a valid target in the <em>target field</em>
it will turn gray and begin to function.</p>

<dl id="bpy-types-constraint-enabled">
<dt>Mute (eye icon)</dt><dd><p>Enable or Disable the constraint. Disabling a constraint will stop its affect on the scene.</p>
<p>Disabling a constraint is useful for turning off a constraint without losing all of its settings.
Disabling means you can enable the constraint at a later time with the settings intact.
Disabling is similar to setting the <a href="common.html#bpy-types-constraint-influence">Influence</a> to 0.0.</p>

<p>Applying a constraint that is not first in the stack will ignore the stack order
(it will be applied as if it was the first one), and may produce undesired results.</p>
