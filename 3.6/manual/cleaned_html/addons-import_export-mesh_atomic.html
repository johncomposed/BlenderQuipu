<h1>Atomic Blender (PDB/XYZ)</h1>
<p>The Atomic Blender (PDB/XYZ) add-on imports atomic structures
(molecules, crystals, clusters, particles, surfaces, etc.), which are described in
PDB (<code>.pdb</code>) and XYZ files (<code>.xyz</code>) (<a href="#import-pdb-xyz">Import PDB/XYZ</a>). The add-on reads the coordinates of
all atoms in the PDB/XYZ file and represents the atoms as balls in the Blender world.
Also the sticks, which are described in PDB files only,
are shown if the sticks are <em>explicitly</em> listed in the PDB file.
The <a href="../../render/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html">Principled BSDF shader</a>
is used to describe the material properties of the atoms.</p>
<p>For the import, many options can be chosen, which allow representing the atoms and sticks in different ways.
With help of several tools in the <a href="#atomic-blender-utilities-panel">Atomic Blender Utilities panel</a>, the atomic structures can be modified
after the import.</p>
<p>Note that the coordinates of selected atomic structures in the Blender 3D world
can also be <em>exported</em> into PDB/XYZ files.</p>
<p><strong>General motivation:</strong> Atomic Blender (PDB/XYZ) is interesting for scientists, who want to
visualize with Blender their atomic structures described in PDB or XYZ files.
Thanks to Blender, fancy graphics of molecules, crystal structures, surfaces,
nanoparticles, clusters and complex atomic arrangements can be obtained.
Such graphics meet the standards of top-level journals, which have a high impact factor.
See <a href="#examples">Examples</a> at the end of this page.</p>

<p><strong>Defects in an Atomic Structure</strong></p>
<p>If you want to show defects like vacancies in an atomic structure, use an ‘X’ for
the element name in the PDB or XYZ file
(<a href="https://development.root-1.de/Atomic_Blender_PDB_XYZ_Remarks.php">see here</a>).
A defect is shown in the form of a cube.</p>

<dt>Instancing Vertices</dt><dd><p>The sticks of one element are put into one instancing vertex structure and the sticks appear as cylinders.
The instancing vertex structure makes the displaying and loading of many sticks relatively fast
(see Section <a href="#the-instancing-vertex-structure">The instancing vertex structure</a> for more info). Options <em>Unit</em> is the length of a unit
(a small cylinder): several of such units are put together forming actually the stick (cylinder).
The longer the unit length is the less is the number of such units and
thus the faster is the displaying. However, if the unit length is too long the stick becomes
eventually longer than the bond length (distance between atoms).
This can then lead to a ‘overlapping effect’ where a stick intersects the atoms. Option <em>Bonds</em>
displays apart from single also double, triple, etc. bonds whereas
option <em>Distance</em> is the distance between the bonds measured in stick diameter.</p>
</dd>

If option <em>Smooth</em> is activated, the initial squarish profile of the sticks changes to a more circular one.
Note that if this option is chosen, there is only one object representing all sticks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Normal</dt><dd><p>Normal cylinders are used. For each bond, one individual cylinder is used.

<h2>The instancing vertex structure</h2>
<figure id="id3">
<figcaption>
<p>The NaCl structure in the outliner.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is essential to understand, how the atoms (and sticks) of an atomic structure are
organized inside Blender. This is why we focus a little bit onto this in the following:</p>
<p>When atomic structures are imported via the PDB or XYZ importer, the atoms are put
into a so-called <em>instancing vertex structures</em>, somewhat into ‘groups’ of elements.
For instance, all sodium atoms of a NaCl structure form one instancing vertex structure,
and the same applies for the chlorine atoms (see figure). In the case of the sodium
atoms, there is a collection <em>Sodium</em> that includes the collection <em>Sodium_atom</em>.
Within the latter, the <em>Sodium_mesh</em> is composed of the mesh itself (<em>Mesh_Sodium</em>)
and a ball called <em>Sodium_ball</em>. The mesh only contains vertices (no objects!),
and the vertices are located at the x,y,z positions specified in the PDB/XYZ file.
What Blender is doing is simply ‘duplicating’ the ‘representative’
ball  <em>Sodium_ball</em> at all the vertices! Because only <strong>one ball</strong> is used, it
makes things incredibly fast by representing, e.g., a thousand of atoms inside Blender.
Note that the representative ball is in the center of the structure,
without having any meaning. This is the reason why the visibility switch
of the representative ball is switched off (see red arrow)!</p>
<p>There are some consequences:
a) The representative ball appears at all vertices with the same orientation.
b) Changing the material properties of the representative ball changes the properties of
all duplicated balls.
c) A ball is NOT an individual object, it is rather a linked member of the
structure. Actually, the object as such does not exist.</p>

<h3>Modifications</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Displacing an ‘individual’ atom</dt><dd><p>For this, the respective vertex has to be displaced: go into the <em>Edit Mode</em>
and select the atom. You can now displace the atom (vertex).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Changing material properties (of all atoms)</dt><dd><p>For this, the material properties of the representative ball must be changed:
in the outliner, switch on the visibility of the representative ball (here,
<em>Sodium_ball</em>, see red arrow in figure). You can then select the ball and change the
material properties. After, make invisible the representative ball, otherwise
it appears in the structure.</p>

<dt>Separate an atom</dt><dd><p>For this, see Section <a href="#separate-atoms">Separate Atoms</a>.</p>

<p>For making the handling of the atomic structures a bit more easy, the utility
panel can be used, see the next Section.</p>
<div>
<p>Hint</p>
<p><strong>Converting All Atoms of an Instancing Vertex Structure to Real Independent Objects</strong></p>
<p>Do the following: Select the atomic structures
with the mouse and use <a href="../../scene_layout/object/editing/apply.html#bpy-ops-object-duplicates-make-real">Make Instances Real</a>.
With this, you produce real independent objects!
In the Outliner, delete the remaining instancing vertex structures,
named like “Carbon”, “Hydrogen”, etc.</p>
<p>Note that if the structures represent many hundreds and thousands
of atoms, Blender can be become quite slow: at once, all these new
atoms are represented as individual ball objects and Blender has to deal with
all of them in several ways. As mentioned above, for each instancing vertex
structure, there is only <em>one representative ball object</em>!</p>

<h3>Custom Data File</h3>
<p>A separate custom data file can be loaded, which contains for each element the following
information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All types of radii (atomic, VdW, ionic) in Å</p></li>
<li><p>Ball color</p></li>
<li><p>Other material properties for the Principled BSDF shader.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Such an option is useful when it is desired to use predefined values for atom
radii and shader properties. An example can be downloaded from here:
<a href="https://development.root-1.de/X-Download/atom_info.dat">Custom data file</a>.</p>
<p>The custom data file is an ASCII file, which can be duplicated and modified by
the user. The radius and material properties of the atoms can be
changed as follows: open the ASCII file with a standard text editor, search
the name of the atom and change the radius (<code>Radius used</code>). Do the same
with, e.g., the RGB values for the color (<code>Color</code>). The value
RGBA(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) corresponds to white and RGBA(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) is
black. Note that the last value of a color tuple is the alpha value of the
color. Furthermore, several other properties such as <code>Metallic</code>,
<code>Roughness</code> and <code>Transmission</code> can be changed. These are the properties
in the <a href="../../render/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html">Principled BSDF shader</a>.
There are also some properties for <a href="../../render/eevee/index.html">Eevee</a>, which
can be used to determine the object’s transparency etc.</p>
<p>Note that in the header of the custom data file,
all possible values of the string options <code>P BSDF Subsurface method</code>,
<code>P BSDF Distribution</code>, <code>Eevee Blend Method</code> and <code>Eevee Shadow Method</code>
are listed.</p>
