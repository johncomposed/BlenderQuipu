<p>Boids particle systems are controlled by a limited artificial intelligence,
which can be programmed to follow basic rules and behaviors.
They are ideal for simulating flocks, swarms, herds and schools of various kind of animals,
insects and fishes or predators vs. preys simulations.
They can react on the presence of other objects and on the members of their own system.
Boids can handle only a certain amount of information,
therefore the sequence of the <em>Boid Brain</em> rules is very important.
In certain situations only the first three parameter are evaluated.</p>

<h3>Deflection</h3>
<p>Boids will try to avoid deflector objects according to the Collision rule’s weight.
It works best for convex surfaces (some work needed for concave surfaces).</p>
</section>
<section id="force-fields">
<h3>Force Fields</h3>
<p>As other physics types, Boids is also influenced by external force fields.</p>
<p>In addition, special <em>Boid</em> force fields can be used with the Boids physics.
These effectors could be predators (positive Strength) that boids try to avoid,
or targets (negative Strength) that boids try to reach
according to the (respectively) <em>Avoid</em> and <em>Goal</em> rules of the <em>Boid Brain</em>.</p>

<h2>Boid Brain</h2>

</div>
<p>The Boid Brain panel controls how the boids particles will react with each other.
The boids’ behavior is controlled by a list of rules.
Only a certain amount of information in the list can be evaluated.
If the memory capacity is exceeded, the remaining rules are ignored.</p>
<p>The rules are by default parsed from top-list to bottom-list
(thus giving explicit priorities),
and the order can be modified using the little arrows buttons on the right side.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Rule Evaluation</dt><dd><p>There are three ways to control how rules are evaluated:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Average</dt><dd><p>All rules are averaged.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Random</dt><dd><p>A random rule is selected for each boid.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fuzzy</dt><dd><p>Uses fuzzy logic to evaluate rules. Rules are gone through top to bottom.
Only the first rule that affect above the <em>Rule Fuzziness</em> threshold is evaluated.
The value should be considered how hard the boid will try to respect a given rule
(a value of 1 means the Boid will always stick to it, a value of 0 means it will never).
If the boid meets more than one conflicting condition at the same time,
it will try to fulfill all the rules according to the respective weight of each.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>A given boid will try as much as it can to comply to each of the rules it is given,
but it is more than likely that some rule will take precedence on other in some cases.
For example, in order to avoid a predator, a boid could probably “forget” about Collision,
Separate and Flock rules, meaning that “while panicked” it could well run into obstacles,
e.g. even if instructed not to, most of the time.</p>
