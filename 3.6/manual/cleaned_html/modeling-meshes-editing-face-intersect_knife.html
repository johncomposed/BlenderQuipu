<p>The Intersect tool lets you cut intersections into geometry.
It is a bit like the Boolean tool, but, does not calculate interior/exterior geometry.
Faces are split along the intersections, leaving new edges selected.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Fast:</dt>
<dd><p>Uses a mathematically simple solver which offers the best performance;
however, this solver lacks support for overlapping geometry.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Merge Threshold</dt><dd><p>Tolerance for close faces to be considered touching.
It may be useful to increase this when some intersections aren’t detected that should be and
when extra geometry is being created because edges aren’t detected as overlapping.</p>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>A threshold approaching the size of faces may cause very slow calculation,
in general keep this value small.</p>

<dd><p>Uses a mathematically complex solver which offers the best results
and has full support for overlapping geometry;
however, this solver is much slower than the <em>Fast Solver</em>.</p>
