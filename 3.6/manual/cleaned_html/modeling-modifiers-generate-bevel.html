<p>The <em>Bevel</em> modifier bevels the edges of the mesh it is applied to,
with some control of how and where the bevel is applied to the mesh.</p>
<p>It is a non-destructive alternative to
the <a href="../../meshes/editing/edge/bevel.html">Bevel Operation</a> in Edit Mode.</p>

<p>The custom profile widget.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This widget allows the creation of a user-defined profile with more complexity than
with the single profile parameter. The modal tool allows toggling the custom profile,
but the shape of the profile is only editable in the options panel after the operation is confirmed.</p>
<p>The profile starts at the bottom right of the widget and ends at the top left, as if it
were between two edges meeting at a right angle. Control points are created in the widget and
then the path is sampled with the number of segments from the Bevel modifier.</p>

<p>The <em>Miter Shape</em> slider stays active when miters are enabled
because it still controls the shape of the miter profiles.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Presets</dt><dd><p>The <em>Support Loops</em> and <em>Steps</em> presets are built dynamically depending on the number of segments in the bevel.
If the number of segments is changed, the preset will have to be re-applied.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sampling</dt><dd><p>Samples will first be added to each control point, then if there are enough samples,
they will be divided evenly between the edges. The <em>Sample Straight Edges</em> option toggles whether
the samples are added to edges with sharp control points on either side. If there aren’t enough samples
to give each edge the same number of samples, they will just be added to the most curved edges,
so it is recommended to use at least as many segments as there are control points.</p>

<h3>Geometry</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Miter Inner/Outer</dt><dd><p>A <em>miter</em> is formed when two beveled edges meet at an angle.
On the side where the angle is greater than 180 degrees, if any, it is called an <em>outer miter</em>.
If it is less than 180 degrees, then it is called an <em>inner miter</em>.
The outer and inner miters can each be set to one of these patterns:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Sharp:</dt>
<dd><p>Edges meet at a sharp point, with no extra vertices introduced on the edges.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Patch:</dt>
<dd><p>Edges meet at a sharp point but in addition, two extra vertices are introduced near the point
so that the edges and faces at the vertex may be less pinched together than
what occurs in the <em>Sharp</em> case.
This pattern does makes no sense for inner miters, so it behaves like <em>Arc</em> for them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Arc:</dt>
<dd><p>Two vertices are introduced near the meeting point, and a curved arc joins them together.</p>
<p>The <em>Spread</em> slider controls how far the new vertices are from the meeting point.</p>
<p>The <em>Profile</em> curve widget controls the shape of the arc.</p>

<dt>Spread</dt><dd><p>The value used to spread extra vertices apart for non-sharp miters.
This option is available when Miter Inner is set to Arc.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Intersections</dt><dd><p>When more than two beveled edges meet at a vertex, a mesh is created as a way to complete the intersection
between the generated geometry. This option controls the method used to create that mesh.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grid Fill:</dt>
<dd><p>The default method for building intersections, useful when a smooth continuation of
the bevel profile is desired. Without <em>Custom Profile</em> enabled, the curve of the profile continues through
the intersection, but with a custom profile it just creates a smooth grid
within the boundary of the intersection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cutoff:</dt>
<dd><p>Creates a cutoff face at the end of each beveled edge coming into the vertex.
This is most useful for custom profiles when the new intersection is too complex for a smooth grid fill.</p>
<p>With a three way intersection, when the inner corners of the cutoff profiles faces meet at
the same location, no center face is created.</p>
<p>The direction of the cutoff faces depends on the original vertex’s normal.</p>

<h3>Shading</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Harden Normals</dt><dd><p>When enabled, the per-vertex face normals of the bevel faces are adjusted to
match the surrounding faces, and the normals of the surrounding faces are not affected.
This will keep the surrounding faces flat (if they were before),
with the bevel faces shading smoothly into them. For this effect to work,
you need custom normals data, which requires <em>Auto Smooth</em> option to be enabled
(see <a href="../../meshes/editing/mesh/normals.html">Normals</a>).</p>
