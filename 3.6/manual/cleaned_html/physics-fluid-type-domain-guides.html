<p>Fluid guides are used to apply forces onto the simulation. They are like simple external forces
but also seek to preserve the physically accurate flow of the fluid.
The <em>Guides</em> panel allows you to adjust guiding forces globally, i.e. for the entire domain.
Enabling the guides hints the fluid solver to use the more accurate,
but also computationally more expensive pressure solving step.</p>
<p>Even when there are no guiding objects baked or there is no guiding domain attached,
the fluid solver will still perform the more expensive pressure guiding algorithm
if guiding is enabled. It is
therefore recommended to only enable <em>Guides</em> when there is a clear intention to
use guiding in the simulation.</p>

<em>Bake Guides</em> writes vertex velocities of effector objects to drive.
It is meant to be used before baking the fluid simulation.</p>

It is possible to pause or resume a <em>Bake Guides</em> process.</p>
