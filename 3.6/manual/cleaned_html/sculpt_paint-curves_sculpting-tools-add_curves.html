<h1>Add Curves</h1>
<p>Used to distribute new curves on the surface mesh.
This tool requires the curve to have a <a href="../introduction.html">surface</a> object set.</p>
<p>The curves follow the surface normals. Using the interpolation options allows the brush to take the characteristics
of existing curves.</p>

<p>Note</p>
<p>Interpolation allows to add hair which are already combed. The new curves are created
following the previously created curves which are in the vicinity.</p>
