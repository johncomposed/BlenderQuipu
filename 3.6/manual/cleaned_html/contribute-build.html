<h1>Building the Manual</h1>
<p>Converting the RST-files into pretty HTML pages is simple.</p>
<p>Open a terminal or Command Prompt in the <code>~/blender-manual</code> directory and simply run:</p>
<div><div><pre>make
</pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>On Microsoft Windows you can simply open the <code>make.bat</code> file to easily
run the command without having to open the Command Prompt and typing commands.</p>
</div>
<p>This is the command you should use when building the docs,
however, other commands are available by typing <code>make help</code>.
This command will convert the RST-files into HTML pages
and automatically open your default web browser to view the result.
The command will continue to run and watch for changes made to the RST-files
and refresh the HTML pages as necessary.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The converted pages can also be viewed manually by browsing the build directory: <code>~/blender-manual/build/html</code>.
For example to open the home page, open <code>build/html/index.html</code> to read the manual.</p>
</div>
<p>The building process may take several minutes the first time (or after any major changes),
but for subsequent changes it should only take a few seconds.</p>
