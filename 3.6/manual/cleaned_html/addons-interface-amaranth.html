<section id="d-view">
<h2>3D View</h2>
<section id="set-camera-bounds-as-render-border">
<h3>Set Camera Bounds as Render Border</h3>
<p>When in camera view, we can now set the border-render to be the same size of the camera,
so we don’t render outside the view. Makes faster render preview.</p>
<p>Usage: Context menus (<kbd>RMB</kbd>) when in Camera View.</p>
</section>
<section id="select-meshlights">
<h3>Select Meshlights</h3>
<p>Select all the meshes that emit light.</p>
<p>Usage: On the header of the 3D View, top of the select menu.</p>
</section>
<section id="adjust-passepartout">
<h3>Adjust Passepartout</h3>
<p>The passepartout value of local Cameras is now available via the context menu,
while in Camera view.</p>
<p>Usage: Context menus (<kbd>RMB</kbd>) when in Camera View.</p>
</section>
<section id="scene-cameras-and-meshlights-count">
<h3>Scene, Cameras, and Meshlights Count</h3>
<p>Add the number of scenes, cameras, and light emitting meshes to the stats in the Status Bar.</p>
<p>Disabled by default as there has been reports of very minor slowdown on scenes with many hi-poly objects.
Never experienced myself but just in case.</p>
<p>Usage: Once enabled in the add-on preferences, it will appear in the Status Bar.</p>
</section>
<section id="wireframe-toggle">
<h3>Wireframe Toggle</h3>
<p>Enable or disable wireframe display on mesh objects.
It even works on linked objects/scenes too, where this option is not accessible.</p>
<p>“Display” will enable the wireframe, while “Clear” will disable it.</p>
<p>Both using the following settings:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Draw All Edges</dt><dd><p>Display edges even on coplanar faces</p>
</dd>
<dt>Subdvision Optimal Display</dt><dd><p>Enable/Disable the “Optimal Display” option on Subdvision modifiers</p>
</dd>
<dt>Only Selected Objects</dt><dd><p>Only apply to the selected objects, otherwise apply to all.</p>
</dd>
<dt>All Scenes</dt><dd><p>Display wireframe on all the objects in all scenes.
Handy when working with linked scenes, where it’s impossible to access the Wireframe option from the UI.</p>
</dd>

</section>
<section id="object-id-for-collection-instances">
<h3>Object ID for Collection Instances</h3>
<p>Override the Pass Index for all objects in the Collection.</p>
<p>In order for the Pass Index to be loaded on computers without Amaranth installed,
it will automatically create a text file (called AmaranthStartup.py) and save it inside the .blend,
this will auto-run on startup and set the Pass Index. Remember to have auto-run Python scripts on your Preferences.</p>
<p>Usage: Select an Instanced Collection and set a Pass Index (other than zero) and press “Apply Object ID to Duplis”
in the Relations panel in Object Properties.</p>
