<dt>Handle Smoothing</dt><dd><p>Selects the method used to compute <a href="#editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles">automatic Bézier handles</a>

From left to right, four <em>Auto Clamped</em> keys, one <em>Vector</em>, and the rest are <em>Automatic</em>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>None:</dt>
<dd><p>Only directly adjacent key values are considered when computing the handles.
Vector handles are pointed directly at the adjacent keyframes.</p>
<p>This older method is very simple and predictable, but it can only produce
truly smooth curves in the most trivial cases. Note the kinks in the yellow curve
around the keys located between the extremes, and near the Vector handles.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Continuous Acceleration:</dt>
<dd><p>A system of equations is solved in order to avoid or minimize jumps in acceleration
at every keyframe. Vector handles are integrated into the curves as smooth transitions
to imaginary straight lines beyond the keyframe.</p>
<p>It produces much smoother curves out of the box, but necessarily means that
any changes in the key values may affect interpolation over a significant stretch
of the curve; although the amount of change decays exponentially with distance.
This change propagation is stopped by any key with <em>Free</em>, <em>Aligned</em>, or <em>Vector</em>
handles, as well as by extremes with <em>Auto Clamped</em> handles.</p>
<p>The mode also tends to overshoot and oscillate more with fully <em>Automatic</em> handles
in some cases (see the right end of the image above). So it is recommended to use
<em>Auto Clamped</em> by default, and only switch to <em>Automatic</em> handles in places
where this is desired behavior. That effect can also be reduced by adding in-between keys.</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Considering the upsides and downsides of each mode, <em>Continuous Acceleration</em> should be
better suited for limited animation, which uses a small number of interpolated keys with
minimal manual polish. In case of highly polished high key rate animation, the benefits of
smoothing may not outweigh the workflow disruption from more extensive change propagation.</p>

<p>Constant.</p>

</figure>
<p>There is no interpolation at all. The curve holds the value of its last keyframe,
giving a discrete (stairway) “curve”.
Usually only used during the initial “blocking” stage in pose-to-pose animation workflows.</p>

</figure>
<p>This simple interpolation creates a straight segment, giving a non-continuous line.
It can be useful when using only two keyframes and the <em>Extrapolation</em> extend mode,
to easily get an infinite straight line (i.e. a linear curve).</p>

<p>Note</p>
<p>Remember that some F-Curves can only take discrete values,
in which case they are always shown as if constant interpolated, whatever option you chose.</p>

<p>Easing (by strength)</p>
<p>Different methods of easing interpolations for F-Curve segment.
The “Robert Penner easing equations” (basically, equations which define some preset ways that
one keyframe transitions to another) which reduce the amount of manual work (inserting and tweaking keyframes)
to achieve certain common effects. For example, snappy movements.</p>

<p>Dynamic Effects</p>
<p>These additional easing types imitate (fake) physics-based effects like bouncing/springing effects.
The corresponding settings can be found in the Sidebar region ‣ Active Keyframe panel.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Back:</dt>
<dd><p>Cubic easing with overshoot and settle.
Use this one when you want a bit of an overshoot coming into the next keyframe,
or perhaps for some wind-up anticipation.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Back</dt><dd><p>The back property controls the size and direction (i.e. above/below the curve) of the overshoot.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Bounce:</dt>
<dd><p>Exponentially decaying parabolic bounce, like when objects collide.
e.g. for Bouncing balls, etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Elastic:</dt>
<dd><p>Exponentially decaying sine wave, like an elastic band.
This is like bending a stiff pole stuck to some surface,
and watching it rebound and settle back to its original state.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Amplitude</dt><dd><p>The amplitude property controls how strongly the oscillation diverges from the basic curve.
At 0.0, there is no oscillation (i.e. it just snaps to the B-value like an extreme exponential transition),
and at 1.0 a profile similar to the one shown in the icon occurs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Period</dt><dd><p>The period property controls the frequency with which oscillations occur.
Higher values result in denser oscillations.</p>

<dl id="editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles">
<dt>Left/Right Handle Type</dt><dd><p>When using Bézier-interpolated curves it is possible to control the slope of the curve at the control points.
This is done via the curve point <em>handles</em>; you can set the type of handle to use
for the curve points by pressing <kbd>V</kbd> or choosing Key, Handle Type in the Graph editor menu.
Each curve point can have a different handle type, even within the same curve.</p>
<p>There are three automatic modes, <em>Automatic</em>, <em>Auto Clamped</em>, and <em>Vector</em>,
where Blender automatically determines the curve’s slope at each control point.
The neighboring control points have the most influence of the slope,
and points further away have a smaller influence. This can be controlled per F-Curve with
the <a href="#bpy-types-fcurve-auto-smoothing">Auto Handle Smoothing</a> properties.</p>
<p>By using the other, non-automatic modes, you have full manual control over the slope.</p>
