<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This format is mainly use for interchanging character animations between applications
and is supported by applications such as Cinema4D, Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max, Wings3D and
engines such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine 3/UDK and Unreal Engine 4.</p>
<p>The exporter can bake mesh modifiers and animation into the FBX so the final result looks the same as in Blender.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bones would need to get a correction to their orientation
(FBX bones seems to be -X aligned, Blender’s are Y aligned),
this does not affect skinning or animation, but imported bones in other applications will look wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Animations (FBX AnimStacks, Blender actions) <strong>are not linked</strong> to their object,
because there is no real way to know which stack to use as ‘active’ action for a given object, mesh or bone.
This may be enhanced to be smarter in the future, but it’s not really considered urgent,
so for now you’ll have to link actions to objects manually.</p></li>
<li><p>Armature instances <strong>are not supported</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bones’ orientation importing is complex, you may have to play a bit with
related settings until you get the expected results.</p></li>
<li><p>Animation support is minimal currently, we read all curves as if they were ‘baked’ ones
(i.e. a set of close keyframes with linear interpolation).</p></li>
<li><p>Imported actions are linked to their related object, bone or shape key, on a ‘first one wins’ basis.
If you export a set of them for a single object, you’ll have to reassign them yourself.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Saving Just Animations</p>
<p>The FBX file format supports files that only contain takes.
It is up to you to keep track of which animation belongs to which model.
The animation that will be exported is the currently selected action within the Action editor.
To reduce the file size, turn off the exporting of any parts you do not want and disable <em>All Actions</em>.
For armature animations typically you just leave the armature enabled which is necessary for
that type of animation. Reducing what is output makes the export and future import much faster.
Normally each action will have its own name but the current or
only take can be forced to be named “Default Take”. Typically, this option can remain off.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Blender now only supports complex node-based shading. FBX having a fixed pipeline-like support of materials,
this add-on uses the <a href="node_shaders_info.html">generic wrapper</a>
featured by Blender to convert between both.</p>

<h3>Export</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Path Mode</dt><dd><p>When referencing paths in exported files you may want some control as to the method used since absolute paths
may only be correct on your own system. Relative paths, on the other hand, are more portable
but mean that you have to keep your files grouped when moving about on your local file system.
In some cases, the path doesn’t matter since the target application will search
a set of predefined paths anyway so you have the option to strip the path too.</p>

Note, when Group/Scene is enabled, you cannot use the animation option <em>Current Action</em>
since it uses scene data and groups are not attached to any scenes.
Also note, when Group/Scene is enabled you must include the armature objects
in the group for animated actions to work.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Batch Own Directory</dt><dd><p>When enabled, each file is exported into its own directory,
this is useful when using the <em>Copy Images</em> option. So each directory contains
one model with all the images it uses. Note, this requires a full Python installation.
If you do not have a full Python installation, this button will not be shown.</p>

<h3>Import</h3>

<h3>Export</h3>
<p>NURBS surfaces, text3D and metaballs are converted to meshes at export time.</p>
<section id="id6">
<h4>Missing</h4>
<p>Some of the following features are missing because they
are not supported by the FBX format, others may be added later.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Object instancing – exported objects do not share data,
instanced objects will each be written with their own data.</p></li>
<li><p>Material textures</p></li>
<li><p>Vertex shape keys – FBX supports them but this exporter does not write them yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Animated fluid simulation – FBX does not support this kind of animation.
You can however use the OBJ exporter to write a sequence of files.</p></li>
<li><p>Constraints – The result of using constraints is exported as a keyframe animation
however the constraints themselves are not saved in the FBX.</p></li>
<li><p>Instanced objects – At the moment instanced objects are only written in static scenes
(when animation is disabled).</p></li>
