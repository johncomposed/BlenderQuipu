<h1>Asset Browser</h1>
<p>This section describes the <em>Asset Browser</em>, which is the main interface for organizing and using assets.</p>
<p>The Asset Browser was introduced in Blender 3.0, and will be improved and
expanded over multiple upcoming releases.</p>

<h2>Using Assets</h2>
<p>As a general rule, <strong>an asset can be used by dragging it from the Asset Browser to the desired location</strong>.
Objects and worlds can be dragged from the Asset Browser into the scene,
Materials can be dragged onto the object that should use them.
Geometry nodes can also be dragged onto objects to add a <a href="../modeling/modifiers/generate/geometry_nodes.html">Geometry Nodes Modifier</a>.
The use of pose assets is different, and is described in <a href="../animation/armatures/posing/editing/pose_library.html">Pose Library</a>.</p>
<p>There are several things that can happen when an asset is used,
depending on the following configuration of the Asset Browser:</p>
<dl id="bpy-types-fileassetselectparams-import-type">
<dt>Import Method</dt><dd><p>Determines how data is managed when an asset is imported.
This option can be found in the center of the Asset Browser header.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Follow Preferences:</dt>
<dd><p>Use the import method set in the Preferences.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Link:</dt>
<dd><p><em>Same as</em> File ‣ Link…</p>
<p>The asset will be linked to the current blend-file, and thus be read-only.
Later changes to the asset file will be reflected in all files that link it in.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Append:</dt>
<dd><p><em>Same as</em> File ‣ Append…</p>
<p>All of the asset and all its dependencies will be appended to the current file.
Dragging a material into the scene three times will result in three independent copies.
Dragging an object into the scene three times will also result in three independent copies.</p>
<p>“Dependencies” in this case means everything the asset refers to.
For an object, this can be its mesh and materials, but also other objects
used by modifiers, constraints, or drivers.</p>
<p>Since the file now has its own copy of the asset, later changes to
the asset file will not be reflected in the file it’s appended to.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Append (Reuse Data):</dt>
<dd><p><em>Specific to the Asset Browser</em>.</p>
<p>The first time an asset is used, it will be appended, including its dependencies,
just like described previously. However, Blender will keep track of where it originated,
and the next time the asset is used, as much data as possible will be reused.
Dragging a material into the scene three times will only load it once,
and just assign the same material three times.
Dragging an object into the scene three times will create three copies of the object,
but all copies will share their mesh data, materials, etc.</p>
<p>Since the file now has its own copy of the asset, later changes to
the asset file will not be reflected in the file it’s appended to.</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p><strong>Instancing Collections</strong></p>
<p><em>Mimics the Instance Collections option when</em> <a href="../files/linked_libraries/link_append.html#bpy-ops-wm-append">appending from the file browser</a></p>
<p>Some asset types such as collections can be created as an instanced collection.
This is done by enabling the <em>Instance</em> option after dragging collection assets into the 3D Viewport.
By enabling this option an empty object is added that uses an instance of the collection.
If this option is disabled then the full collection hierarchy will be added to the scene.</p>
<p>Collection Assets from the current file will always be instanced.</p>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that all regular Blender operations are available after the asset has been added to the current file.
For example, you could choose to link an object to the scene; this will also link its mesh and its materials.
Then you can make the object itself local
(Object ‣ Relations ‣ Make Local… ‣ Selected Objects),
while keeping the mesh and materials linked to the asset files. This will result in a local,
and thus editable, object, and keep the mesh and materials automatically up to date with
any changes in the asset library.</p>

<h2>Asset Previews</h2>
<figure id="id4">
<figcaption>
<p>Preview panel in the Asset Browser.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Preview images are typically automatically generated when you
<a href="../files/asset_libraries/introduction.html#bpy-ops-asset-mark">mark a data-block as asset</a>. The auto-generated
preview tries to capture the object from the front. However this only works if
the geometry is laid out so that it matches what Blender considers to be the
front. That is, the geometry that should be the front needs to point down the -Y
axis of the object. The rotation may have to be applied to get the expected
result. Collection assets use the global -Y  axis as the front (instead of the
local one, as collections themselves don’t have a rotation).</p>
<p>It’s also possible to load image files from drive, to replace the auto-generated previews.</p>
<p>For previews of pose assets, see <a href="../animation/armatures/posing/editing/pose_library.html#poselib-preview-images">Controlling the Look of Preview Images</a>.</p>

<section id="asset-bundles">
<h2>Asset Bundles</h2>
<p><em>Asset bundles</em> are blend-files that do not reference any other file,
and whose name ends in <code>_bundle.blend</code>. Any textures and other external
files need to be <a href="../files/blend/packed_data.html">packed</a> into the current blend-file.</p>
<p>Asset bundles can be copied to an asset library via the <a href="#bpy-ops-asset-bundle-install">Asset Browser</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open the asset bundle blend-file.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch its Asset Browser to <em>Current File</em> (if it’s not set at that already).</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <em>Copy Bundle to Asset Library</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the asset library to copy it to.</p></li>
<li><p>A File Browser will open, showing the files of the selected asset library.
Choose the desired location of the blend-file, and click the <em>Copy to Asset Library</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>The blend-file will be saved at the chosen location, and any <a href="../files/asset_libraries/catalogs.html">catalogs</a> of
the asset bundle will be merged into the target asset library.</p></li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Both the word “asset” and the word “bundle” are commonly used,
and not necessarily with the same meaning as described here.
Not everything that’s presented as an “asset bundle” will have
the <em>Copy to Asset Library</em> functionality available; for that,
the bundle file needs to adhere to the definition above.</p>
