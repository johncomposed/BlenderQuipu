<h1>Geometry to Instance Node</h1>
<p>The <em>Geometry to Instance</em> node turns every connected input geometry into an instance.
Visually, the node has a similar result as the <a href="join_geometry.html">Join Geometry Node</a>,
but it outputs the result as separate instances instead. The geometry data itself isnâ€™t actually
joined.</p>
<p>The node can be used in combination with the <em>Pick Instances</em> option in the
<a href="../instances/instance_on_points.html">Instance on Points Node</a>, as a way to pick
between geometry generated in the node tree (as opposed to picking from separate
instances from the <a href="../input/scene/collection_info.html">Collection Info Node</a>, for example).</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>This node can be much faster than the join geometry node when the inputs are large geometries.
This is because the join geometry node must actually create a larger mesh, or a larger curve.
Even though the operation is simple, just creating a large mesh can have a significant cost.
This node can be better, because instead of merging large geometries, it just groups them
together as instances.</p>
