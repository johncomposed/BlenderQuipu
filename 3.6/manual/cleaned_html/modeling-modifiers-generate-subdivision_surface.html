<h1>Subdivision Surface Modifier</h1>
<p>The <em>Subdivision Surface</em> modifier (often shorten to “Subdiv”)
is used to split the faces of a mesh into smaller faces, giving it a smooth appearance.
It enables you to create complex smooth surfaces while modeling simple, low-vertex meshes.
It avoids the need to save and maintain huge amounts of data,
and gives a smooth “organic” look to the object.</p>
<p>As with any modifier, order of execution (position in the <a href="../introduction.html#modifier-stack">modifier stack</a>)
has an important bearing on the results.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a different operation than its companion,
<a href="../../meshes/editing/mesh/shading.html#modeling-meshes-editing-normals-shading">Smooth Shading</a>.
You can see the difference between the two in the grid image below.</p>

<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>The <em>Subdivision Surface</em> modifier does not allow you to edit the new subdivided geometry without applying it,
but the <a href="multiresolution.html">Multiresolution</a> modifier does (in Sculpt Mode).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>This modifier uses
the <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/intro.html">OpenSubdiv library</a> as a backend.</p>

According to its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Clark_subdivision_surface">Wikipedia page</a>,
the “arbitrary-looking formula was chosen by Catmull and Clark based on the aesthetic appearance of
the resulting surfaces rather than on a mathematical derivation.”</p>

To work around this behavior for non-coplanar geometry,
<a href="triangulate.html">triangulate</a> to ensure all geometry is coplanar.</p>

<p>Warning</p>
<p>Higher levels of subdivisions results in more vertices, which means higher memory consumption
(both system RAM, and video memory for display).
This can cause Blender to hang or crash if not enough memory is available.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>The right combination of these settings will allow you to keep a fast and lightweight approximation of
your model when interacting with it in the 3D Viewport, but use a higher quality version when rendering.</p>
<p>Be careful not to set the <em>Viewport</em> subdivisions higher than the <em>Render</em> subdivisions,
this would mean that the quality in the 3D Viewport will be higher than the rendered.</p>

<section id="keyboard-shortcuts">
<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>To quickly add a <em>Subdivision Surface</em> modifier to one or more objects, select the object(s) and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>1</kbd></kbd>.
That will add a Subdivision Surface modifier with <em>Viewport</em> subdivisions set to 1.
You can use other numbers too, such as <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>2</kbd></kbd>, <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>3</kbd></kbd>, etc,
to add a modifier with that number of subdivisions.
Adding a <em>Subdivision Surface</em> modifier in this fashion will not modify the <em>Render</em> subdivisions.</p>
<p>If an object already has a <em>Subdivision Surface</em> modifier,
doing this will simply change its subdivision level instead of adding another modifier.</p>
</section>
<section id="control">
<h2>Control</h2>
<p>Catmull-Clark subdivision rounds off edges, and often this is not what you want.
There are several solutions that allow you to control the subdivision.</p>
<section id="weighted-edge-creases">
<h3>Weighted Edge Creases</h3>
<p>Weighted edge creases for subdivision surfaces allows you to change the way
the <em>Subdivision Surface</em> modifier subdivides the geometry to give the edges a smooth or sharp appearance.</p>
<figure id="id3">
<figcaption>
<p>A subdivided cube with creased edges.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The crease weight of selected edges can be changed in the <em>Transform</em> panel, Sidebar of the 3D Viewport.
The scale-like dedicated tool <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>E</kbd></kbd> can also be used to adjust the crease weight.
A higher value makes the edge “stronger” and more resistant to the smoothing effect of subdivision surfaces.</p>
</section>
<section id="edge-loops">
<h3>Edge Loops</h3>
<figure id="id4">
<figcaption>
<p>Subdivision Level 2 cube, the same with an extra Edge Loop, and the same with six extra Edge Loops.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <em>Subdivision Surface</em> modifier demonstrates why good, clean topology is so important.
As you can see in the figure, it has a drastic effect on a default cube.
Until you add in additional loops (with e.g. <a href="../../meshes/editing/edge/loopcut_slide.html#bpy-ops-mesh-loopcut-slide">Loop Cut and Slide</a>),
the shape is almost unrecognizable as a cube.</p>
<p>A mesh with deliberate topology has good placement of edge loops, which allow the placement of more loops
(or their removal) to control the sharpness/smoothness of the resultant mesh.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="known-limitations">
<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
<section id="non-contiguous-normals">
<h3>Non-Contiguous Normals</h3>
<p>Abrupt normal changes will prevent portions of the mesh from producing a smooth subdivision.
Instead, these portions with non-contiguous normals will be subdivided using the “Simple” subdivision method.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>A quick way to fix this is to <a href="../../meshes/editing/mesh/normals.html">Recalculate Normals</a>.
If this does not work you may have to <a href="../../meshes/editing/mesh/normals.html">manually flip the normals</a>.</p>
