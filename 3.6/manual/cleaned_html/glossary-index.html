<h1>Glossary</h1>
<p>This page lists definitions for terms used in Blender and this manual.</p>
<dl>
<dt id="term-Action-Safe">Action Safe</dt><dd><p>Area of the screen visible on most devices. Place content inside it to ensure it does not get cut off.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-Active">Active</dt><dd><p>When many items are selected, the last selected item will be the active one.
Used in situations where the interface only shows options for one item at a time.</p>
<p>See also <a href="../scene_layout/object/selecting.html#object-active">selection states</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-Aliasing">Aliasing</dt><dd><p>Rendering artifacts in the form of jagged lines.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-Alpha-Channel">Alpha Channel</dt><dd><p>Additional channel in an image for transparency.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Straight Alpha</dt><dd><p>Method where RGBA channels are stored as (R, G, B, A)
channels, with the RGB channels unaffected by the alpha channel.
This is the alpha type used by paint programs such as Photoshop or Gimp,
and used in common file formats like PNG, BMP or Targa.
So, image textures or output for the web are usually straight alpha.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Premultiplied Alpha</dt><dd><p>Method where RGBA channels are stored as (R × A, G × A, B × A, A),
with the alpha multiplied into the RGB channel.</p>
<p>This is the natural output of render engines, with the RGB channels representing the amount
of light that comes toward the viewer, and alpha representing how much of the light from
the background is blocked. The OpenEXR file format uses this alpha type. So, intermediate files
for rendering and compositing are often stored as premultiplied alpha.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Conversion (Straight/Premultiplied) Alpha</dt><dd><p>Conversion between the two alpha types is not a simple operation and can involve data loss,
as both alpha types can represent data that the other cannot, though it is often subtle.</p>
<p>Straight alpha can be considered to be an RGB color image with a separate alpha mask.
In areas where this mask is fully transparent, there can still be colors in the RGB channels.
On conversion to premultiplied alpha, this mask is <em>applied</em> and the colors in such areas
become black and are lost.</p>
<p>Premultiplied alpha, on the other hand, can represent renders that are both emitting light
and letting through light from the background. For example, a transparent fire render might
be emitting light, but also letting through all light from objects behind it.
On converting to straight alpha, this effect is lost.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Channel Packed</dt><dd><p>A separate image map is stored for each color and alpha channel.

</dd>
<dt id="term-Directional-Light">Directional Light</dt><dd><p>The light that has a specific direction, but no location.

</dd>
<dt id="term-Displacement-Mapping">Displacement Mapping</dt><dd><p>A method for distorting vertices based on an image or texture.
Similar to <a href="#term-Bump-Mapping">Bump Mapping</a>, but instead operates on the mesh’s actual geometry.
This relies on the mesh having enough geometry to represent details in the image.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-Display-Referenced">Display Referenced</dt><dd><p>Refers to an image whose <a href="#term-Luminance">Luminance</a> channel is limited to a certain range of values (usually 0-1).
The reason it is called display referenced is because a display cannot display an infinite range of values.

from one to the other.</p>
</dd>

there is only one distance at which a subject is precisely in focus, but focus falls off gradually on either
side of that distance, so there is a region in which the blurring is tolerable. This region is greater behind
the point of focus than it is in front, as the angle of the light rays change more rapidly;
they approach being parallel with increasing distance.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-Double-Buffer">Double Buffer</dt><dd><p>Technique for rendering and displaying content on the screen.

</dd>
<dt id="term-Euler">Euler</dt><dt id="term-Euler-Rotation">Euler Rotation</dt><dd><p>Rotation method where rotations are applied to each of the X, Y, Z axes in a specific order.</p>
<p>Euler orders in Blender are most intuitive when read backwards: <em>XYZ Euler</em> is similar to rotating
around <em>Local Z</em> using the <em>Rotate</em> tool in the 3D Viewport, followed by <em>Local Y</em> and then <em>Local X</em>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="term-Face-Normal">Face Normal</dt><dd><p>The normalized vector perpendicular to the plane that a <a href="#term-Face">Face</a> lies in. Each face has its own normal.</p>

<dt id="term-Keyframe">Keyframe</dt><dd><p>A frame in an animated sequence drawn or otherwise constructed directly by the animator.
In classical animation, when all frames were drawn by animators,

<dt id="term-Manifold">Manifold</dt><dd><p>Manifold meshes, also called ‘water-tight’ meshes, define a closed non-self-intersecting volume
(see also <a href="#term-Non-manifold">Non-manifold</a>). A manifold mesh is a mesh in which the structure of the connected
faces in a closed volume will always point the normals (and their surfaces) to the outside

they will always point at a predictable direction (to the outside or to the inside of the volume).
When working with non-closed volumes, a manifold mesh is a mesh in which
the normals will always define two different and non-consecutive surfaces.
A manifold mesh will always define an even number of non-overlapped surfaces.</p>

Mip-mapping is the process used to calculate lower resolutions of

<dt id="term-Non-manifold">Non-manifold</dt><dd><p>Non-Manifold meshes essentially define geometry which cannot exist in the real world.
This kind of geometry is not suitable for several types of operations,
especially those where knowing the volume (inside/outside) of the object is important
(refraction, fluids, Boolean operations, or 3D printing, to name a few).
A non-manifold mesh is a mesh in which the structure of
a non-overlapped surface (based on its connected faces) will not determine
the inside or the outside of a volume based on its normals, defining
a single surface for both sides, but ended with flipped normals.
When working with non-closed volumes, a non-manifold mesh will always
determine at least one discontinuity in the normal directions, either
by an inversion of a connected loop, or by an odd number of surfaces.
A non-manifold mesh will always define an odd number of surfaces.</p>
<p>There are several types of non-manifold geometry:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some borders and holes (edges with only a single connected face), as faces have no thickness.</p></li>
<li><p>Edges and vertices not belonging to any face (wire).</p></li>
<li><p>Edges connected to three or more faces (interior faces).</p></li>
<li><p>Vertices belonging to faces that are not adjoining (e.g. two cones sharing the vertex at the apex).</p></li>
