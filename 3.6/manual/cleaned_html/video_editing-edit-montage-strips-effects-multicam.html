<h1>Multicam Selector Strip</h1>
<p>The Multicam Selector strip is used for multi-camera editing.
Multi-camera editing is when a scene is recorded using multiple cameras from different angles
and then edited together afterwards.</p>
<section id="workflow">
<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>The process of multi camera editing can be rather easy in the Video Sequencer if properly setup.
The following guide shows the basic steps to setup a basic multi camera editing workflow.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First you are going to want to add in each of your video strips.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, you will want to sync all your cameras by either using
<a href="../sound.html">Audio Waveforms</a> or by the movement of objects.</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>To make syncing strips easier you can group cameras, their audio,
and their effects together using <a href="../../meta.html">Meta Strips</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Split the editor into many <a href="../../../../../editors/video_sequencer/preview/index.html">Previews</a>, one for each input track.
Then change the <a href="../../../../../editors/video_sequencer/preview/sidebar.html#bpy-types-spacesequenceeditor-display-channel">Display Channel</a>
of each of the previews to the channel number of the input track.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a Multicam Selector strip <em>above</em> all the video channel tracks.</p>
<p>After completing these steps you should get something similar to the following image:</p>
<figure id="id2">

</figure>
</li>
<li><p>Now select the Multicam strip, if you take a look at the strip options (in the Sidebar),
you will notice, that Multicam is a rather simple effect strip:
It just takes a selected channel as its input. That is all.
The magic comes with the convenient keyboard layout.</p></li>
<li><p>When you select the Multicam strip, the keys <kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>9</kbd> are mapped to the cut buttons.
So, select the Multicam strip and start playback and press the keys
for the correct input while watching the individual cameras.</p></li>
<li><p>You will end up with a small Multicam Selector strip for every cut.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In reality, it boils down to: watch a few seconds to see, what is coming,
watch it again and do a rough cut using the number keys.
Then fine-tune the placement by selecting the outer handles of two neighboring Multicam for A/B rolling.</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>To improve playback performance enable <a href="../../../../../editors/video_sequencer/sequencer/sidebar/proxy.html">Proxies</a>.</p>
