<p>Blender offers several ways of mapping UVs.
The simpler projection methods use formulas that map 3D space onto 2D space,
by interpolating the position of points toward a point/axis/plane through a surface.
The more advanced methods can be used with more complex models, and have more specific uses.</p>

<p>Flattens the mesh surface by cutting along <a href="../uv/unwrapping/seams.html">seams</a>.
Useful for organic shapes.</p>
<p>Begin by selecting all the faces you want to unwrap.
In the 3D Viewport, select UV ‣ Unwrap or <kbd>U</kbd> and select Unwrap.
You can also do this from the UV Editor with UV ‣ Unwrap or <kbd>U</kbd>.
This method will unwrap all faces and reset previous work.
The UVs menu will appear in the UV Editor after unwrapping has been performed once.</p>

<p>This tool unwraps the faces of the object to provide
the “best fit” scenario based on how the faces are connected and will fit within the image,
and takes into account any seams within the selected faces.
If possible, each selected face gets its own different area of the image and is not overlapping any other faces UVs.
If all faces of an object are selected, then each face is mapped to a part of the image.</p>
<section id="options">

<p>Tip</p>
<p>A face’s UV image texture only has to use <em>part</em> of the image, not the <em>whole</em> image.
Also, portions of the same image can be shared by multiple faces.
A face can be mapped to less and less of the total image.</p>

<p>Smart UV Project, cuts a mesh based on an angle threshold (angular changes in your mesh).
This gives you fine control over how automatic seams are created.
It is a good method for simple and complex geometric forms,
such as mechanical objects or architecture.</p>
<p>This algorithm examines the shape of your object,
the selected faces and their relation to one another,
and creates a UV map based on this information and settings that you supply.</p>
<p>In the example below,
the Smart Mapper mapped all of the faces of a cube to a neat arrangement of three sides on top,
three sides on the bottom, for all six sides of the cube to fit squarely,
just like the faces of the cube.</p>

<p>Lightmap Pack takes each of a mesh’s faces, or selected faces,
and packs them into the UV bounds. Lightmaps are used primarily in realtime rendering,
where lighting information is baked onto texture maps,
when it is needed to use as much UV space as possible.
It can also work on several meshes at once.
It has several options that appear in the Toolbar:</p>
<p>You can set the tool to map just <em>Selected Faces</em> or <em>All Faces</em> if
working with a single mesh.</p>
<p>The <em>Selected Mesh Object</em> option works on multiple meshes. To use this,
in <em>Object Mode</em> select several mesh objects,
then go into <em>Edit Mode</em> and activate the tool.</p>

<p>Spherical mapping is similar to cylinder but the difference is that
a cylindrical mapping projects the UVs on a plane toward the cylinder shape,
while a spherical map takes into account the sphere’s curvature,
and each latitude line becomes evenly spaced.
<em>Sphere Projection</em> is useful for spherical shapes, like eyes, planets, etc.</p>
<p>Recall the opening cartographer’s approaching to mapping the world? Well,
you can achieve the same here when unwrapping a sphere from different points of view.
Normally, to unwrap a sphere, view the sphere with the poles at the top and bottom.
After unwrapping, Blender will give you an equirectangular projection;
the point at the equator facing you will be in the middle of the image.
A polar view will give a very different but common projection map.
Using an equirectangular projection map of the earth as the UV image
will give a good planet mapping onto the sphere.</p>
