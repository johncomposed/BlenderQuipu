<h1>Brush Settings</h1>
<p>Each mode and brush has unique brush settings.
But there is also a lot of overlap or similar settings.
This page explains general and mode specific settings that are used across various brushes in more detail.</p>
<section id="general">
<h2>General</h2>
<dl id="bpy-types-brush-size">
<dt>Radius</dt><dd><p>This option controls the size of the brush, measured in pixels.
<kbd>F</kbd> allows you to change the brush size interactively by
dragging the mouse from left to right and then <kbd>LMB</kbd> to accept.
Meanwhile the texture of the brush will be visible inside the circle.
You can also enter the size numerically with the number keys.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Size Pressure</dt><dd><p>Brush size can be affected by enabling the pressure sensitivity icon,
if you are using a <a href="../../getting_started/configuration/hardware.html#hardware-tablet">Graphics Tablet</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use Unified Radius</dt><dd><p>Use the same brush <em>Radius</em> across all brushes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Radius Unit Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>Controls how the brush <em>Radius</em> is measured.</p>
<dl>
<dt>View</dt><dd><p>The <em>Radius</em> is measured based on how the cursor appears on the monitor i.e. “screen space”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Scene</dt><dd><p>The <em>Radius</em> is measured based on real world units.
This means that the brush radius stays consistent, independently from zooming in and out in the viewport.
The unit type and scaling can be configured in the <a href="../../scene_layout/scene/properties.html#bpy-types-unitsettings">Scene Units</a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-brush-strength">
<dt>Strength</dt><dd><p>For painting brushes the <em>Strength</em> defines the maximum effect of each brush stroke.
For example, higher values cause a <em>Paint</em> brush to give each stroke a higher opacity.
The opacity is never stronger than the set <em>Strength</em>,
no matter how often the same surface is painted during the same stroke.</p>
<p>For sculpting brushes on the other hand the <em>Strength</em> relates to how strong each step of the stroke is,
resulting in a slower/faster buildup towards the full brush effect during the stroke.</p>
<p>You can change the brush strength interactively by pressing <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>F</kbd></kbd>
and then moving the brush and then <kbd>LMB</kbd>.
You can also enter the strength numerically with the number keys.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Strength Pressure</dt><dd><p>Brush strength can be affected by enabling the pressure sensitivity icon,
if a supported tablet is being used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use Unified Strength</dt><dd><p>Use the same brush <em>Strength</em> across all brushes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Blend</dt><dd><p>Set the way the color or value is applied over the targeted Color Attribute, Vertex Group or Image Texture.
See <a href="../../glossary/index.html#term-Color-Blend-Modes">Color Blend Modes</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add Alpha: makes the image more opaque where painted.</p></li>
<li><p>Erase Alpha: makes the image transparent where painted,
allowing background colors and lower-level textures to show through.
As you “paint”, the false checkerboard background will be revealed.
Using a tablet pen’s eraser end will toggle on this mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>In order to see the effects of the Erase and Add Alpha mix modes in the Image Editor,
the <a href="../../editors/image/introduction.html#bpy-types-spaceimageeditor-display-channels">Display Channels</a>
must be set to <em>Color &amp; Alpha</em> or <em>Alpha</em>.
Transparent (no alpha) areas will then show a checkered background.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Weight Weight Paint</dt><dd><p>The weight value that is applied to the vertex group.</p>
<p>Use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>LMB</kbd></kbd> to sample the weight value of clicked vertex.
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>LMB</kbd></kbd> lets you select the group from which to sample from.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-brush-direction">
<dt>Direction <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>Brush direction toggle, <em>Add</em> raises geometry towards the brush,
<em>Subtract</em> lowers geometry away from the brush. This setting can be toggled with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while sculpting.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-brush-normal-radius-factor">
<dt>Normal Radius Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>Determines the ratio of how much the brush radius is used to
sample the normal direction of the sculpt plane of the brush.
For example, a smaller <em>Normal Radius</em> will lead to drastic changes in the brush orientation,
like for following the contours of hard surface meshes more closely.
A large <em>Normal Radius</em> will lead to smoother changes in orientation,
like for building overall forms on organic sculptures.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-brush-area-radius-factor">
<dt>Area Radius</dt><dd><p>The ratio between the brush radius and
the radius that is going to be used to sample the area plane depth.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dt>Hardness Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>How close the brush falloff starts from the edge of the brush.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-brush-tip-roundness">
<dt>Tip Roundness</dt><dd><p>The factor to control how round the brush is. A value of zero will make the brush square.
Note, the <a href="falloff.html">Brush Falloff</a>
is only applied to the rounded portions of the brush.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-brush-auto-smooth-factor">
<dt>Auto-smooth Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>Sets the amount of smoothing to be applied to each stroke.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="bpy-types-brush-topology-rake-factor">
<dt>Topology Rake Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>The higher this setting is set, the more <a href="../sculpting/tool_settings/dyntopo.html">Dyntopo</a>
aligns mesh edges to the brush direction while tessellating the surface.
This generates cleaner edge flow to help define sharp features.
<em>Topology Rake</em> can have a severe performance impact so it works best on low-poly meshes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Normal Weight <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>Constrains brush movement along the surface normal.
Especially useful with the <em>Grab</em> brush, can be temporarily enabled by holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.
E.g. <em>Grab</em> brush can be used to push a depression (hole) into the mesh when <em>Normal Weight</em> is set.</p>
<p>Applies to <em>Grab</em> and <em>Snake Hook</em> brushes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Plane Offset Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>Offset for planar brushes (Clay, Fill, Flatten, Scrape),
shifts the plane that is found by averaging the faces above or below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Plane Trim Sculpt Mode</dt><dd><p>Ability to limit the distance that planar brushes act.
If trim is enabled vertices that are further away from the offset plane than
the trim distance are ignored during sculpting.</p>
