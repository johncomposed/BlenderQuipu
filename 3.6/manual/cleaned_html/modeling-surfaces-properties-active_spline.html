<dt>Cyclic U/V</dt><dd><p>Like curves, surfaces can be closed (cyclical) or open, independently in both directions,
allowing you to easily create a tube, torus or sphere shape,
and they can be viewed as “solids” in <em>Edit Mode</em>.
This can be set per interpolation axis.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bézier U</dt><dd><p>Makes the surface act like a Bézier curve.
The control points act like <em>Free</em> handles of a Bézier curve.
Depending on the <em>Order</em>, 3 or 4 control points form one spline segment.
This can be set per interpolation axis.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Endpoint U/V</dt><dd><p>Makes the surface contact the end control points.
This can be set per interpolation axis.</p>

<p>In the image below, the U interpolation axis is labeled as “U”
and the V interpolation axis is labeled as “V”.
The U’s interpolation axis has been set to <em>Endpoint</em>
and as such the surface now extends to the outer edges from
E1 to E2 along the U interpolation axis.</p>
<p>To cause the surface to extend to all edges,
<em>Endpoint</em> would be set for the V’s axis as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Order U/V</dt><dd><p>This property is the same as with <a href="../../curves/properties/active_spline.html#modeling-curve-order">NURBS Curves</a>;
it specifies how much the control points are taken into account for calculating the curve of the surface shape.
For high Orders 1 the surface pulls away from the control points,
creating a smoother surface by assuming that the <em>Resolution U/V</em> is high enough.
For lowest Orders 2 the surface follows the control points,
creating a surface that tends to follow the grid cage.</p>

<p>For illustration purposes, in both Fig. <a href="#fig-surface-intro-order">Order 2 and Order 4 surface.</a>,
the knot vectors were set to <em>Endpoint</em>, causing the surface to extend to all edges.</p>
<p>You can set independently the order for each interpolation axis,
and like curves, it <strong>cannot</strong> be lower than 2,
and higher than 6 or the number of control points on the relevant axis.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Resolution U/V</dt><dd><p>Alters the <a href="shape.html#bpy-types-curve-resolution-v">resolution</a>
of each segment by changing the number of subdivisions.
This can be set per interpolation axis.</p>
