<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Curves are 2D objects, and surfaces are their 3D extension.
Note however, that in Blender, you only have NURBS surfaces,
no Bézier (you have the <em>Bézier</em> knot type, though; see below),
nor polygonal (but for these, you have meshes!).
Even though curves and surfaces share the same object type (with texts also…),
they are not the same thing; for example,
you cannot have in the same object both curves and surfaces.</p>

<p>As surfaces are 2D, they have two interpolation axes, U (as for curves) and V.
It is important to understand that you can control the interpolation rules (knot, order, resolution)
<em>independently</em> for each of these two dimensions
(the U and V fields for all these settings, of course).</p>
<p>You may ask yourself “but the surface appears to be 3D, why is it only 2D?”.
In order to be 3D, the object needs to have “Volume”, and a surface, even when it is closed,
does not have volume; it is infinitely thin.
If it had a volume the surface would have a thickness (its third dimension). Hence,
it is only a 2D object, and has only two interpolation dimensions or axes or coordinates
(if you know a bit of math, think of non-Euclidean geometry – well,
surfaces are just non-Euclidean 2D planes…). To take a more “real-world” example,
you can roll a sheet of paper to create a cylinder; well, even if it becomes a “volume”,
the sheet itself will remain a (nearly…) 2D object!</p>
<p>In fact, surfaces are very similar to the results you get when
<a href="../curves/properties/geometry.html">extruding a curve</a>.</p>

<h2>Visualization</h2>
<p>There is nearly no difference from NURBS curves,
except that the U direction is indicated by yellow grid lines,
and the V one is materialized by pink grid lines, as you can see in
Fig. <a href="#fig-surface-intro-surface">NURBS surface in Edit Mode.</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="../curves/editing/curve.html#curves-show-hide">hide and reveal</a> control points just as with curves.</p>
</section>
<section id="conversion">
<h2>Conversion</h2>
<p>As there are only NURBS surfaces, there is no “internal” conversion here.</p>
<p>However, there is an “external” conversion available, from surface to mesh,
that only works in Object Mode. It transforms a surface object into a mesh one,
using the surface resolutions in both directions to create faces, edges and vertices.</p>
