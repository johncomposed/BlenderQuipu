A fully transparent surface is treated as if there is no surface there at all;
a partially transparent surface is treated as if only part of the light rays can pass through.
This means it is not included in the Transmission passes;

<section id="cryptomatte">
<h2>Cryptomatte</h2>
<p>Cryptomatte is a standard to efficiently create mattes for compositing.
Cycles outputs the required render passes, which can then be used in the Blender Compositor
or another compositor with Cryptomatte support to create masks for specified objects.</p>
<p>Unlike the Material and Object Index passes, the objects to isolate are selected in compositing.
The mattes will be anti-aliased and take into account effects like motion blur and transparency.</p>

<h2>Shader AOV</h2>
<p>Shader AOVs (Arbitrary Output Variables) provide custom render passes for any shader node components.
As an artist this can be a good way to fix or tweak fine details of a scene in post-processing.
To use Shader AOVs create the pass in the <em>Shader AOV</em> panel then reference this pass with
the <a href="../shader_nodes/output/aov.html">AOV Output</a> shading node.
Shader AOVs can be added or removed in the <em>Shader AOV</em> panel.
In this panel is a list of all AOV passes; each AOV in the list consists of a <em>Name</em> and <em>Data Type</em>.</p>

<dl id="bpy-types-aov-type">
<dt>Data Type</dt><dd><p>Shader AOVs can either express a <em>Color</em> or a <em>Value</em> output.

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Alpha blended materials are not rendered in render passes except the combined pass.
Use the <em>Alpha Clip</em> or <em>Alpha Hashed</em> as <a href="../eevee/materials/settings.html#bpy-types-material-blend-method">Blending Mode</a>
to render transparent materials in render passes.</p></li>
<li><p>Depth of field is not rendered in render passes except the combined pass.
It is possible to add the depth of field back in the Compositor using
the <a href="../../compositing/types/filter/defocus.html#bpy-types-compositornodedefocus">Defocus node</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Eevee render passes exclude parts of the BSDF equation.
<a href="../shader_nodes/converter/shader_to_rgb.html">Shader to RGB</a> is not supported as it needs
