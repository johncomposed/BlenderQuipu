<p>As bones behave like objects in <em>Pose Mode</em>, they can also be constrained.
This is why the <em>Constraints</em> tab is shown in both <em>Object Mode</em> and <em>Edit Mode</em>.
This panel contains the constraints <em>of the active bone</em>
(its name is displayed at the top of the panel, in the <em>To Bone:â€¦</em> static text field).</p>
<p>Constraining bones can be used to control their degree of freedom
in their pose transformations, using e.g. the <em>Limit</em> constraints.
You can also use constraints to make a bone track another object/bone
(inside the same object, or in another armature), etc.
And the <a href="index.html#bone-constraints-inverse-kinematics">inverse kinematics feature</a>
is also mainly available through the <em>IK Solver</em> constraint, which is specific to bones.</p>
<p>For example, a human elbow cannot rotate backward (unless the character has broken their arm),
nor to the sides, and its forward and roll rotations are limited in a given range.
(E.g. depending on the rest position of your elbow, it may be from (0 to 160) or from (-45 to 135).)</p>
<p>So you should apply a <em>Limit Rotation</em> constraint to the forearm bone
(as the elbow movement is the result of rotating the forearm bone around its root).</p>
<p>Using bones in constraints, either as owners or as targets, is discussed in detail
in the <a href="../../../constraints/index.html">constraints pages</a>.</p>
