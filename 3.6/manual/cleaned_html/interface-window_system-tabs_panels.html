<p>Tabs are used to control overlapping sections in the user interface.
The content of only one Tab is visible at a time.
Tabs are listed in a <em>Tab header</em>, which can be horizontal or vertical.</p>
<section id="switching-cycling">
<h3>Switching/Cycling</h3>
<p>Vertical tabs can be switched with <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Wheel</kbd></kbd> from anywhere in the tab.
You can also cycle through tabs with <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> and
<kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd>, or press down <kbd>LMB</kbd> and move the mouse over the tab header icons.
(This does not apply to Workspace tabs; see <a href="workspaces.html#workspaces-controls">Workspace controls</a>.)</p>

<p>The smallest organizational unit in the user interface is a panel.
The panel header shows the title of the panel. It is always visible.
Some panels also include subpanels.</p>
<section id="collapsing-and-expanding">
<h3>Collapsing and Expanding</h3>
<p>A panel can either be expanded to show its contents, or collapsed to hide its contents.
An expanded panel is indicated by a down-arrow (▼) in the panel header,
while a collapsed panel is shown with a right-arrow (►).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clicking <kbd>LMB</kbd> on the panel header expands or collapses it.</p></li>
<li><p>Pressing <kbd>A</kbd> expands/collapses the panel under the mouse pointer.</p></li>
<li><p>Clicking <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>LMB</kbd></kbd> on the header of a collapsed panel will expand it and collapse all others.</p></li>
<li><p>Clicking <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>LMB</kbd></kbd> on the header of an expanded panel will expand/collapse all its subpanels.</p></li>
<li><p>Dragging with <kbd>LMB</kbd> over the headers will expand or collapse many at once.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="position">
<h3>Position</h3>
<p>You can change the position of a panel within its region by clicking
and dragging the grip widget (::::) on the right side of its header.</p>
</section>
<section id="pinning">
<h3>Pinning</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is desirable to view panels from different tabs at the same time.
Like, for instance, having access to a camera’s properties, while other objects are selected.
This has been solved by making panels pinnable.</p>
<p>A pinned panel remains visible regardless of which tab has been selected.
You can pin a panel by clicking on the pin icon in its header.
Panels that do not have a pin icon can be pinned by <kbd>RMB</kbd> on the panel header
and selecting <em>Pin</em>, or by pressing <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>LMB</kbd></kbd>.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Pinning is not available for all panels. For example, it’s available in the Sidebar
but not in the Properties editor.</p>
