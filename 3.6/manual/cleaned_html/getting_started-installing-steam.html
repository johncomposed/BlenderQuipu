<h1>Installing from Steam</h1>
<p>Steam is a software distribution platform. Blender can be downloaded and updated
using the Steam client by following the steps described below on Linux, macOS, or Windows.</p>
<p>Download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam client</a> for your operating system.
Once installed, open the client and login to your Steam account, or create one if you haven’t already.
Once logged in, navigate to the <em>Store</em> tab, search for “Blender”, and press the green installation button.
Blender should now be available in the <em>Library</em> tab of the Steam client.</p>

described on the <a href="linux.html">Linux</a> and
