<h1>GPU Rendering</h1>
<p><abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit">GPU</abbr> rendering makes it possible to use your
graphics card for rendering, instead of the CPU. This can speed up rendering
because modern GPUs are designed to do quite a lot of number crunching.
On the other hand, they also have some limitations in rendering complex scenes, due to more limited memory,
and issues with interactivity when using the same graphics card for display and rendering.</p>
<p>To enable GPU rendering, go into the Preferences ‣ System ‣ Cycles Render Devices,
and select either <em>CUDA</em>, <em>OptiX</em>, <em>HIP</em>, <em>oneAPI</em>, or <em>Metal</em>. Next, you must configure each scene to
use GPU rendering in Properties ‣ Render ‣ Device.</p>
<section id="rendering-technologies">
<h2>Rendering Technologies</h2>
<p>Blender supports different technologies to render on the GPU depending on the particular GPU manufacturer
and operating system.</p>
<section id="cuda-nvidia">
<h3>CUDA – NVIDIA</h3>
<p><abbr title="Compute Unified Device Architecture">CUDA</abbr> is supported on Windows and Linux and requires a
Nvidia graphics cards with compute capability 3.0 and higher. To make sure your GPU is supported,
see the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute">list of Nvidia graphics cards</a>
with the compute capabilities and supported graphics cards.</p>
</section>
<section id="optix-nvidia">
<h3>OptiX – NVIDIA</h3>
<p>OptiX is supported on Windows and Linux and requires a Nvidia graphics cards with compute capability 5.0 and higher
and a driver version of at least 470. To make sure your GPU is supported,
see the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute">list of Nvidia graphics cards</a>.</p>
<p>OptiX takes advantage of hardware ray-tracing acceleration in RTX graphics cards, for improved performance.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<section id="why-is-blender-unresponsive-during-rendering">
<h3>Why is Blender unresponsive during rendering?</h3>
<p>On older GPU generations, graphics cards can only either render or draw the user interface.
This can make Blender unresponsive while it is rendering.
Heavy scenes can also make Blender unresponsive on newer GPUs, when using a lot of memory or executing expensive shaders, however this is generally less of a problem.</p>
<p>The only complete solution for this is to use a dedicated GPU for rendering, and another for display.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-does-a-scene-that-renders-on-the-cpu-not-render-on-the-gpu">
<h3>Why does a scene that renders on the CPU not render on the GPU?</h3>
<p>There may be multiple causes,
but the most common one is that there is not enough memory on your graphics card.
Typically, the GPU can only use the amount of memory that is on the GPU
(see <a href="#would-multiple-gpus-increase-available-memory">Would multiple GPUs increase available memory?</a> for more information).
This is usually much smaller than the amount of system memory the CPU can access.
With CUDA, OptiX, HIP and Metal devices, if the GPU memory is full Blender will automatically
try to use system memory. This has a performance impact, but will usually still result in a faster render
than using CPU rendering.</p>
</section>
<section id="can-multiple-gpus-be-used-for-rendering">
<h3>Can multiple GPUs be used for rendering?</h3>
<p>Yes, go to Preferences ‣ System ‣ Compute Device Panel, and configure it as you desire.</p>
</section>
<section id="would-multiple-gpus-increase-available-memory">
<h3>Would multiple GPUs increase available memory?</h3>
<p>Typically, no, each GPU can only access its own memory.</p>
<p>The exception is NVIDIA GPUs connected with NVLink, where multiple GPUs can share memory at a small performance cost. This is can be enabled with <a href="../../editors/preferences/system.html#prefs-system-cycles-distributive-memory">Distributed Memory Across Devices</a> in the preferences.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-renders-faster">
<h3>What renders faster?</h3>
<p>This varies depending on the hardware used. Different technologies also have different compute times
depending on the scene tested. For the most up to date information on the performance of different devices,
browse the <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Open Data</a> resource.</p>

<section id="error-messages">
<h2>Error Messages</h2>
<p>In case of problems, be sure to install the official graphics drivers from the GPU manufacturers website,
or through the package manager on Linux.
The graphics drivers provided by the computer manufacturer can sometimes be outdated or incomplete.</p>
<section id="error-out-of-memory">
<h3>Error: Out of memory</h3>
<p>This usually means there is not enough memory to store the scene for use by the GPU.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>One way to reduce memory usage is by using smaller resolution textures.
For example, 8k, 4k, 2k, and 1k image textures take up respectively 256MB, 64MB, 16MB and 4MB of memory.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="the-nvidia-opengl-driver-lost-connection-with-the-display-driver">
<h3>The NVIDIA OpenGL driver lost connection with the display driver</h3>
<p>If a GPU is used for both display and rendering,
Windows has a limit on the time the GPU can do render computations.
If you have a particularly heavy scene, Cycles can take up too much GPU time.
Reducing Tile Size in the Performance panel may alleviate the issue,
but the only real solution is to use separate graphics cards for display and rendering.</p>
<p>Another solution can be to increase the time-out,
although this will make the user interface less responsive when rendering heavy scenes.

<section id="unsupported-gnu-version">
<h3>Unsupported GNU version</h3>
<p>On Linux, depending on your GCC version you might get this error.
See the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/10.2/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html">Nvidia CUDA Installation Guide for Linux</a>
for a list of supported GCC versions. There are two possible solutions to this error:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Use an alternate compiler</dt><dd><p>If you have an older GCC installed that is compatible with the installed CUDA toolkit version,
then you can use it instead of the default compiler.
This is done by setting the <code>CYCLES_CUDA_EXTRA_CFLAGS</code> environment variable when starting Blender.</p>
<p>Launch Blender from the command line as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre>CYCLES_CUDA_EXTRA_CFLAGS="-ccbin gcc-x.x" blender
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(Substitute the name or path of the compatible GCC compiler).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Remove compatibility checks</dt><dd><p>If the above is unsuccessful, delete the following line in
<code>/usr/local/cuda/include/host_config.h</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre>#error -- unsupported GNU version! gcc x.x and up are not supported!
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will allow Cycles to successfully compile the CUDA rendering kernel the first time it
attempts to use your GPU for rendering. Once the kernel is built successfully, you can
launch Blender as you normally would and the CUDA kernel will still be used for rendering.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="cuda-error-kernel-compilation-failed">
<h3>CUDA Error: Kernel compilation failed</h3>
<p>This error may happen if you have a new NVIDIA graphics card that is not yet supported by
the Blender version and CUDA toolkit you have installed.
In this case Blender may try to dynamically build a kernel for your graphics card and fail.</p>
<p>In this case you can:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Check if the latest Blender version
(official or <a href="https://builder.blender.org/download/">experimental builds</a>)
supports your graphics card.</p></li>
<li><p>If you build Blender yourself, try to download and install a newer CUDA developer toolkit.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Normally users do not need to install the CUDA toolkit as Blender comes with precompiled kernels.</p>
