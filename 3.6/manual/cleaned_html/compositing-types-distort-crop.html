<h1>Crop Node</h1>
<p>The Crop node crops an input image to a selected region
by either making the cropped area transparent or by resizing the input image.</p>
<section id="inputs">
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Image</dt><dd><p>Standard color input. If no image is selected, an image filled with the selected color is used.
You can use and crop this image in combination with another background image.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Crop Image Size</dt><dd><p>When disabled, the image remains the same size, but the cropped areas become transparent pixels.
When enabled, the image size is cropped to the specified region and gets a new width or height or both.</p>
<p>Note that this will probably reposition the image in the render output
because the cropped image is automatically centered.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Relative</dt><dd><p>When enabled, crop dimensions are a percentage of the input image’s width and height.
When disabled, the range of the <em>Crop Region Values</em> are the width and height of the image in pixels.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Crop Region Values</dt><dd><p>Define borders of the crop region; <em>Left</em> or <em>Right</em> can vary between 0 and the width of the image.
<em>Up</em> or <em>Down</em> can vary between 0 and the height of the image.</p>
</dd>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The terminology (<em>Left</em>, <em>Right</em>, <em>Up</em>, <em>Down</em>) can be misunderstood easily.
First, the numbers do not represent the amount of cropping,
e.g. <em>Left</em> is set to 50 and <em>Right</em> to 50 does not mean that you will be
cropping the image for 50 pixels on both the left and right side.
In fact, it will result in zero-sized image because you are cropping from pixel 50 to pixel 50.
So, the numbers defines a position in the input image.</p>
<p>Secondly, depending on which one is bigger, <em>Left</em> should be interpreted as <em>Right</em> and vice versa.
If <em>Left</em> is greater than <em>Right</em> then both values are switched and <em>Left</em> gets the value of <em>Right</em>
and vice versa. The same operation is done for <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em>, where you can think of them as the top
and bottom of the image.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the terms <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em> are ambiguous and suggest an action; e.g. “Crop down”.
The values, however, are not amounts but positions.
The term <em>Down</em> should be interpreted as “Bottom” and <em>Up</em> as “Top”.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The following workflow removes some possible confusion:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Uncheck <em>Crop Image Size</em> for this step, so that you can see the borders of the input image.
To see this border, you have to select the Viewer node.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t need pixel-perfect cropping, check <em>Relative</em> so that
you do not have to consider the exact dimensions of the input image.</p></li>
<li><p>Set <em>Left</em> and <em>Down</em> to zero. Set <em>Right</em> and <em>Up</em> to one, or to the width and height of the input image.
You should see now the entire input image in the backdrop. <em>Up</em> is thus interpreted as the top of the image.
The origin of the image (0, 0) is at the bottom (down) left corner.</p></li>
<li><p>To crop from the left, change the <em>Left</em> value. To crop from the right, change the <em>Right</em> value.
To crop from the top, change the <em>Up</em> value. To crop from the bottom, change the <em>Down</em> value.</p></li>
