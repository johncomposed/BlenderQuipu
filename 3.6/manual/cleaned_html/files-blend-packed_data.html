<h1>Packed Data</h1>
<p>Blender has the ability to encapsulate (incorporate)
various kinds of data within the blend-file that is normally saved outside of the blend-file.
For example, an image texture that is an external image file can be put “inside” the blend-file.
This allows sharing a full project as a single file,
instead of e.g. an archive containing the blend-file and all its dependencies.</p>
<p>You know that a data is packed when you see a little “gift box” icon displayed next to its path.</p>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Not all external files can be packed</p>
<p>Some typically heavy external files, like videos from the <a href="../../video_editing/introduction.html">Sequence Editor</a>
or <a href="../../editors/clip/introduction.html">Movie Clips</a>, cannot be packed in a blend-file.</p>
</div>

<p>When enabled, this option will ensure that all eligible external resource files, existing or added later,
are systematically marked as packed.
As with <em>Pack Resources</em>, the blend-file must be saved to the drive for this to have an effect.</p>
<p>Disabling that option won’t unpack anything, but future external files
won’t be automatically marked as packed anymore.</p>
