<h1>Painting</h1>
<p>Sculpt Mode also allows painting your geometry via
<a href="../../../modeling/meshes/properties/object_data.html#modeling-meshes-properties-object-data-color-attributes">Color Attributes</a> such as Vertex Colors. This ensures that the most
common actions related to the sculpting workflow are contained in the same mode, to avoid unnecessary mode switching.</p>
<p>Other sculpt mode features such as face sets, masking and filters can also be used with painting tools.</p>
<p>The painting functionality in Sculpt Mode is limited to a
<a href="../tools/paint.html">Paint</a>
and <a href="../tools/smear.html">Smear</a> brush,
as well as a <a href="../tools/color_filter.html">Color Filter</a>
and <a href="../tools/mask_by_color.html">Mask by Color</a> tool.</p>
<p>Just like any other brush, <kbd>Shift</kbd> can be used to smooth.
In the case of painting brushes it will blur the colors within the brush radius instead.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Once any painting tool is executed, the <a href="../../../editors/3dview/display/shading.html#viewport-shading-solid-color">viewport color shading</a> is switched
to “Attribute”.  This ensures that color attributes are shown on all objects once painting is needed.</p>
