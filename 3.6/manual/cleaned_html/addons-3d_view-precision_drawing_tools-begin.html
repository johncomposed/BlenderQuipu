<h1>Before You Begin</h1>
<p>There are a number of principles to be aware of before you begin working with PDT:</p>
<p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://github.com/Clockmender/Precision-Drawing-Tools/wiki/98-PDT-Latest-Release-Menus">latest-menus</a> to see current layouts.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>PDT is split into several sections and this list will grow as the add-on develops.</p></li>
<li><p>PDT has a concept of a <code>Working Plane</code> that applies in all Operations,
i.e. those defined in the Design section and some in the Pivot Point section.</p></li>
<li><p>PDT has been designed to work as far as possible in Edit and
Object modes with many commands equally applicable to both.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain Operations relating to <code>Cursor Placement</code> and <code>Pivot Point Placement</code>
have been set to work in either Selected, or Relative Modes, these will be explained later.</p></li>
<li><p>PDT can be driven from its own Command Line input for <strong>most</strong> operations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing to establish is the <code>Working Plane</code>, here a number of choices are available:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>Front(X-Z)</code> - Uses Global X and Z axes, if you want to work from the Back view,
the working plane is also this as the axes remain the same.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Top(X-Y)</code> - Uses Global X and Y axes, if you want to work from the Bottom view,
the working plane is also this as the axes remain the same.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Right(Y-Z)</code> - Uses Global Y and Z axes, if you want to work from the Left view,
the working plane is also this as the axes remain the same.</p></li>
<li><p><code>View</code> - This uses axes relative to your screen, no matter how the 3D View is rotated,
X is always view-horizontal, Y is always view-vertical and Z is always view-depth.</p></li>
</ol>
<section id="setting-the-working-plane">
<h2>Setting the Working Plane.</h2>
<p>Whatever your <code>View</code> is set to other than <strong>View</strong>,
it does not matter how the view is oriented, inputs are always along global axes.</p>
<p>The second thing is whether you want Cursor, or Pivot Point locations to be based upon <code>Selected</code>,
or <code>Current</code> values. Set <code>Selected</code> if you want the Cursor to be placed relative to selected geometry,
or <code>Current</code> if you want it to be placed relative to its current location.
For example, moving the cursor in <code>Current</code> mode by a <code>Delta</code>
input of 1,3,2 will move the cursor relative to itself,
so it moves this amount every time you activate the command.</p>
</section>
<section id="setting-the-cursor-pivot-point-movement-mode">
<h2>Setting the Cursor/Pivot Point Movement Mode.</h2>
<p>Then you can set the type of Operation you want to undertake,
these will be discussed on another page. There are a number of Operations, shown below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Cursor.</p></li>
<li><p>Pivot Point.</p></li>
<li><p>Move.</p></li>
<li><p>New Vertex.</p></li>
<li><p>Extrude Vertices.</p></li>
<li><p>Split Edges.</p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate Geometry.</p></li>
<li><p>Extrude Geometry.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="setting-the-operation-mode">
<h2>Setting the Operation Mode.</h2>
<p>Setting the <cite>Operation</cite> mode determines what the buttons below this command actually do,
so for example to <strong>move</strong> the <code>Cursor</code> to <code>Absolute</code> location, you would select <code>Cursor</code> operation,
set the input values for <strong>X, Y &amp; Z</strong> then click the <code>Absolute</code> button.</p>
<p>Below is a table showing which options are available in which Modes, including Edit, or Object Modes in Blender:</p>
<p>Note! Only Edit and Object Modes are supported by PDT at present,
Further, only Mesh Objects are supported, not Curves for now.</p>
<p>Note! From Version 1.1.8, Menu widths will affect how the menus are arranged,
with less items per row as the width decreases below a threshold set in the PDT add-onâ€™s Preferences.
Here are two sample Images:</p>
<p>Note! PDT Add-on Preferences now also sets the Parts Library location and Debug mode.</p>
