<h1>Explode Modifier</h1>
<p>The <em>Explode</em> modifier is used to alter the mesh geometry by moving/rotating its faces in a way
that roughly tracks particles emitted by that object, making it look as if the mesh is being exploded
(broken apart and pushed outward).</p>
<p>For this modifier to have any visible effect, there needs to be a particle system on its object.
That particle system will control how the mesh is exploded.</p>
<p>Both the number of emitted particles and number of faces determine how granular the <em>Explode</em> modifier is.
More of each faces and particles will mean more individual pieces.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://archive.blender.org/wiki/index.php/File:Manual_-_Explode_Modifier_-_Exploding_Cube_-_2.5.ogg/">demo video</a> showing a cube with a particle system and <em>Explode</em> modifier. (<a href="https://archive.blender.org/wiki/index.php/File:Manual_-_Explode_Modifier_-_Exploding_Cube_-_2.5.blend">blend-file</a>).</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The <em>Explode</em> modifier must come after the <em>Particle System</em> one in the <a href="../introduction.html#modifier-stack">modifier stack</a>,
in order for the former to get required data from the later.</p>

<p>The V value is set to a constant 0.5 value.</p>
<p>You can for example vary the color of a fragment (face) during the explosion phase,
by using a texture with a color gradient along its <em>U</em> axis.</p>

<dt>Cut Edges</dt><dd><p>Split the mesh in pieces based on location of emitted particles, instead of using existing faces.
This will typically results in a splitting that appears more random.</p>

<dt>Vertex Group</dt><dd><p>Vertices in this group may not be affected by the <em>Explode</em> modifier.
Vertices with full weight are not affected at all,
while vertices with less weight have a higher chance of being affected.</p>
<p>Vertices with null weight will be treated like those which do not belong to the group at all,
and explode normally.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Invert <code>&lt;-&gt;</code></dt><dd><p>Inverts the influence of the selected vertex group, meaning that the group
now represents vertices that will not be deformed by the modifier.</p>
<p>The setting reverses the weight values of the group.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Protect</dt><dd><p>Clean vertex group edges. Depending on the weights assigned to that vertex group,
either completely protect those faces from being affected by the <em>Explode</em> modifier
(which would happen if the faces had a weight value of 1),
or completely remove protection from those faces
(which would happen if the faces had a weight value of 0).</p>

<h3>Dynamic Vertex Weights</h3>
<p>This modifier uses the initial vertex weights.
Modifiers that dynamically change weights will not influence the explosion as these values are only used once.</p>
