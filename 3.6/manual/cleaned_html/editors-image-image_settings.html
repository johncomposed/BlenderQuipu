<h3>Movie</h3>
<p>A video file. Note that if you want to do motion tracking and video compositing
rather than simply using the video as a texture, you should load it into the

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Blender plays all videos at the scene framerate, not their original framerate,
meaning they’ll be faster or slower than intended if these framerates don’t match up.
To work around this, see the <em>Offset</em> field of the Image Texture Node
linked above.</p>

<dt>Color Space</dt><dd><p>The <a href="../../glossary/index.html#term-Color-Space">Color Space</a> the image file was saved in. This is used for converting
the image to linear color (which is the color space Blender works with).</p>
<p>Textures and final renders are often stored in sRGB,
while OpenEXR images are stored in a linear color space.
Some images such as normal, bump or stencil maps do not strictly contain “colors”
and should never have a color conversion applied to them.
For such images, the color space should be set to <em>Non-Color</em>.</p>
<p>The list of color spaces depends on the active <a href="../../render/color_management.html#ocio-config">OCIO config</a>.
The default supported color spaces are described in detail here:

This option is only available if the image format supports transparency.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Straight:</dt>
<dd><p>Store RGB and alpha channels separately with alpha acting as a mask, also known as unassociated alpha.
Commonly used by image editing applications and file formats like PNG.
This preserves colors in parts of the image with zero alpha.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Premultiplied:</dt>
<dd><p>Store RGB channels with alpha multiplied in, also known as associated alpha.
The natural format for renders and used by file formats like OpenEXR.
This can represent purely emissive effects like fire correctly, unlike straight alpha.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Channel Packed:</dt>
<dd><p>Different images are packed in the RGB and alpha channels, and they should not affect each other.
Channel packing is commonly used by game engines to save memory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>None:</dt>

<dt>Seam Margin</dt><dd><p>The thickness of the margin around UV islands for texture painting to bleed into. This margin ensures that
no unpainted pixels remain at the island border.</p>
<figure id="id3">
<figcaption>
<p>Painting a stroke across a seam in 3D space makes it extend past the UV island borders in the texture,
until it gets cut off at the margin.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A higher value will result in a thicker margin, which can be useful if you intend to create mipmaps
of the texture. However, this may also reduce painting performance.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>This setting only affects Sculpt Mode, where texture painting support is currently experimental.
In Texture Paint Mode, a fixed margin is used instead.</p>
