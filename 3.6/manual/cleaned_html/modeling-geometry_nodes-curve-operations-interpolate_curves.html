<h1>Interpolate Curves Node</h1>
<p>Generate new curves on points by interpolating between existing curves.
This is useful to have a smaller set of original curves to make editing easier and faster
while still generating high-density curves for the viewport or a final render.</p>
<section id="inputs">
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Guide Curves</dt><dd><p>Base curves that new curves are interpolated between.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Guide Up</dt><dd><p>Optional up vector that is typically a surface normal. Supplying an up vector will improve
the quality of the interpolation, making it aware of the surface shape which it otherwise
wouldn’t have a way to know about.</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>In a typical “child hair” generation setup, this up direction is retrieved with a combination
of the <a href="../../mesh/sample/sample_uv_surface.html">Sample UV Surface Node</a> using the same geometry
that the points were distributed on, and the <a href="../../geometry/read/normal.html">Normal Node</a>.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Guide Group ID</dt><dd><p>Splits guides into separate groups. New curves interpolate existing curves from a single group.
This input can be useful for generating hair parts by stopping curves in different sections
(with different group IDs) from affecting each other.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Points</dt><dd><p>The positions of the first root control points of the newly generated interpolated curves.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Points Up</dt><dd><p>Optional up vector that is typically a surface normal.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Point Group ID</dt><dd><p>The curve group to interpolate in.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Max Neighbor</dt><dd><p>Maximum amount of close guide curves that are taken into account for interpolation.</p>

<p>Note</p>
<p>Internally this node mixes the data from multiple guide curves, with the maximum number
of sources depending on the <em>Max Neighbor</em> input. This output is only the index of the curve
with the largest weight.</p>
