<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In Blender, objects are not directly part of the scenes.
Instead, they all get stored in a main database (basically the blend-file).</p>
<figure id="id1">

</figure>
<p>From there they are referenced into as many Scenes as you would like to see them.</p>
<p>When they are stored in a scene, they are part of a so-called <em>scene collection</em>.
So ultimately all the scene objects belong to this special collection.</p>

<section id="collections">
<h2>Collections</h2>
<p>While the <em>scene collection</em> contains all the Scene’s objects,
the user can also make their own collections to better organize these objects.</p>
<p>It works like a Venn diagram, where all the objects are part of the <em>scene collection</em>,
but can also be part of multiple collections.</p>

<p>The result is a clear and flexible way to arrange objects together on the Scene level.</p>

<section id="naming-and-nesting">
<h2>Naming and Nesting</h2>
<p>Collections can be named and sorted hierarchically.
Just like folders can have subfolders in any operating system,
collections can have nested collections too.</p>

<p>For example: a <em>house</em> collection can contain a <em>bedroom</em> collection,
which in turn contains a <em>furniture</em> collection referencing a bed, a cabinet and other objects.</p>

<section id="color-tagging">
<h2>Color Tagging</h2>
<p>Collections can have a color group assigned to them; helping organize
and group different collections. This color tag is displayed as part of
the collection icon in the <a href="../../editors/outliner/index.html">Outliner</a>
and various other menus. The available colors are defined by
Blender’s interface <a href="../../editors/preferences/themes.html">Theme</a>.</p>
<p>To assign a color to a collection,
use the <a href="../../editors/outliner/editing.html#bpy-ops-outliner-collection-color-tag-set">Set Color Tag</a> tool in the Outliner.</p>
