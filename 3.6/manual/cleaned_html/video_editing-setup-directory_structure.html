<h1>Directory Structure</h1>
<p>A video project is most likely a combination of several different assets.
You can separate them into three broad categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Video files: video clips (or movies in Blender-talk), photos, graphic files (charts, logos, …),
and Visual Effects (VFX) such as masks, lens flares, animation.</p></li>
<li><p>Audio files: recorded dialog, voice-over, music, and Sound Effects (SFX) such as environmental sounds, swooshes, …</p></li>
<li><p>Project files: the blend files and backups, (partial) render results, documentation such as scripts and storyboards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Together they can form rapidly an intangible heap of files.
It’s good practice to collect all those assets in <em>one</em> project directory with appropriate subdirectories.
Why? It will lower the probability that you accidentally delete a file
(which will result in a ‘file not found’ error) or that you forget
to include a necessary file when transferring the project (‘file is missing’ error).
And most of all, an appropriate directory structure, will help you to keep a clear overview of your assets.</p>

<p>Blender can incorporate some files within the Blend file (see <a href="../../files/blend/packed_data.html">Packed Data</a>).
However, this doesn’t work with video files, which can have very huge file sizes.
So, it’s better to assure that your project directory contains all necessary files.</p>

<p>It’s also good practice to use some kind of naming convention and add metadata.
Figure 1 shows a possible example, based on our categorization of the assets above.
The directories are numbered so that they mimic a normal workflow.</p>
