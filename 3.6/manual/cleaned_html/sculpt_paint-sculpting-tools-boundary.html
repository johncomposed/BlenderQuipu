</div>
<p>Similar to the <a href="pose.html">Pose</a> brush
but deforms the open boundaries of a mesh.
The tool detects the mesh boundary closest to the active vertex and
propagates the deformation using the brush <a href="../../brush/falloff.html">Falloff</a> into the mesh.</p>
<p>The main use cases of this brush are the <em>Bend</em> and <em>Expand</em> geometry,
which leads to the best results on evenly distributed quad based topology.
Use the <em>Inflate</em>, <em>Grab</em>, <em>Twist</em>, and <em>Smooth</em> deformation modes,
to further adjustments and tweaks to the result
(which do not depend that much on a clean topology).</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Boundaries to hidden geometry will also be counted as an open boundary.</p>
</div>
<p>The boundary origin is displayed via a white line, which indicates the reach of the deformation.
The targeted boundary that will be deformed is highlighted in the brush cursor color.</p>
<p>If the <a href="../../brush/brush_settings.html#bpy-types-brush-deform-target">Deformation Target</a>
is changed, the brush can also be used for cloth sculpting.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Evenly distributed and quad based topology will lead to much better results.
Triangles and N-gons are also supported but may lead to unpredictable outcomes.</p>
