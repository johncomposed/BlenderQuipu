<p>Bendy Bones (B-Bones) are an easy way to replace long chains of many small rigid bones.
A common use case for curved bones is to model spine columns or facial bones.</p>
<section id="technical-details">
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>Blender treats the bone as a section of a Bézier curve passing through the bones’ joints.
Each of the <em>Segments</em> will bend and roll to follow this invisible curve
representing a tessellated point of the Bézier curve.
The control points at each end of the curve are the endpoints of the bone.
The shape of the B-Bones can be controlled using a series of properties or
indirectly through the neighboring bones (i.e. first child and parent).
The properties construct handles on either end of the bone to control the curvature.</p>
<p>When using the B-bone as a constraint target <a href="../../../../interface/controls/templates/data_block.html#ui-data-id">Data ID</a> offers an option to follow the curvature.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>However, if the bone is used as a target rather than to deform geometry,
only <em>Armature</em> and <em>Copy Transforms</em> constraints will use the full
transformation including roll and scale.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="display">
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>You can see these segments only if bones are visualized as <em>B-bones</em>.</p>
<p>When not visualized as <em>B-Bone</em>s, bones are always shown as rigid sticks,
even though the bone segments are still present and effective.
This means that even in e.g. <em>Octahedron</em> visualization,
if some bones in a chain have several segments,
they will nonetheless smoothly deform their geometry.</p>
</section>
<section id="rest-pose">
<h2>Rest Pose</h2>
<p>The initial shape of a B-Bone can be defined in Edit Mode as a rest pose of that bone.
This is useful for curved facial features like curved eyebrows or mouths.</p>
<p>B-Bones have two sets of the Bendy Bone properties – one for Edit Mode (i.e. the Rest Pose/Base Rig) and
another for Pose Mode – adding or multiplying together their values to get the final transforms.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig-rig-bone-intro-bbone">Bones with just one segment in Edit Mode.</a> we connected three bones,
each one made of five segments.</p>
<p>Look at Fig. <a href="#fig-rig-bone-intro-same">The same armature in Object Mode.</a>,
we can see how the bones’ segments smoothly “blend” into each other, even for roll.</p>

These values are proportional to the default length,
which of course automatically varies depending on bone length,
angle with the reference handle, and so on.</p>

<h3>Custom Handles</h3>
<p>B-Bones can use custom bones as their reference bone handles, instead of only using the connected parent/child bones.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Automatic:</dt>
<dd><p>The connected parent (or first connected child) of the bone is chosen as the handle.
Calculations are done according to the <em>Absolute</em> handle type below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Absolute:</dt>
<dd><p>The Bézier handle is controlled by the <strong>position</strong> of the head (tail)
of the handle bone relative to the head (tail) of the current bone.
Note that for this to work, there must be a nonzero distance between these bones.
If the handle is also a B-Bone, additional processing is applied to further
smooth the transition, assuming that the bones in effect form a chain.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Relative:</dt>
<dd><p>The Bézier handle is controlled by the <strong>offset</strong> of the head (tail) of the handle bone from its rest pose.
The use of this type is not recommended due to numerical stability issues near zero offset.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tangent:</dt>
<dd><p>The Bézier handle is controlled by the <strong>orientation</strong> of the handle bone, independent of its location.</p>

<dl id="bpy-types-editbone-bbone-custom-handle-end">
<dt>Custom Handle</dt><dd><p>For types other than <em>Automatic</em>, a bone to use as handle has to be manually selected.
Switching to a custom handle type without selecting a bone can be used to effectively disable the handle.</p>
<p>It is valid for two bones to refer to each other as handles – this correlation is applied
in connected chains with <em>Automatic</em> handles.</p>

<dl id="bpy-types-editbone-bbone-handle-use-ease-end">
<dt>Scale X/Y/Z/Ease</dt><dd><p>If enabled, the final Scale and/or Ease values are multiplied by the corresponding local scale
channels of the handle bone. This step is applied independently of <em>Scale Easing</em> and doesn’t
interact with it, i.e. enabling <em>Y</em> and <em>Scale Easing</em> doesn’t replace the <em>Ease</em> toggle.
These toggles are a more efficient replacement for up to eight trivial drivers passing segment scale data
from the handle bones into the B-Bone option properties.</p>
