<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Each blend-file contains a database.
This database contains all scenes, objects, meshes, textures, etc. that are in the file.</p>
<p>A file can contain multiple <a href="../scene_layout/scene/introduction.html">Scenes</a>
and each scene can contain multiple <a href="../scene_layout/object/introduction.html">Objects</a>.
Objects can contain multiple materials which can contain many textures.
It is also possible to create links between different objects, or share data between objects.
A file can link data from other Blender files.</p>
<section id="outliner">
<h2>Outliner</h2>
<p>You can easily inspect the contents of your file by using the <em>Outliner</em> editor,
which displays all of the data in your blend-file.</p>
<p>The <em>Outliner</em> allows you to do simple operations on objects,
such as selecting, renaming, deleting, linking and parenting.</p>
